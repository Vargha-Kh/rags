Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith, included as one of the goals of his Ten Year Plan the preparation of a Synopsis and Codification of the Laws and Ordinances of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas as an essential prelude to its translation. He himself worked on the codification, but had not finished it when he died in 1957. The task was continued on the basis of his work, and the resulting volume was released in 1973. That publication included, in addition to the Synopsis and Codification itself and explanatory notes, a compilation of the passages from the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas which had already been translated by Shoghi Effendi and published in various books. The Synopsis and Codification covered the text of both the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas and the Questions and Answers which constitutes an appendix to the Aqdas. In 1986 the Universal House of Justice decided that the time had come when the preparation of an English translation of the complete text of the Most Holy Book was both possible and essential and made its accomplishment a goal of the Six Year Plan 1986\u20131992. Its publication in English will be followed by translations in other languages.\nIt has been recognized that the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas, being Sacred Scripture, should be presented in a form which can be read with ease and inspiration, uncluttered with the footnotes and index numbers that are common in scholarly texts. Nonetheless, to assist the reader in following the flow of the text and its changing themes, paragraph divisions have been added\u2014such divisions not being common in works of Arabic literature\u2014and these paragraphs have then been numbered for ease of access and indexing, as well as for uniformity of reference in all the languages in which the work will be published.\nFollowing the text of the Aqdas is a brief compilation of Writings of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h which are supplementary to the Most Holy Book, and a translation of the Questions and Answers published here for the first time.\nShoghi Effendi had stated that the English translation of the Aqdas should be \u201ccopiously annotated.\u201d The policy followed in preparing the notes has been to concentrate on those points which might strike a non-Arabic-speaking reader as obscure or which, for various reasons, require elucidation or background information. They are not intended to be a comprehensive commentary on the text beyond these fundamental requirements.\nThe notes, which are placed following the Synopsis and Codification, are numbered sequentially. Each is preceded by a quotation of the passage to which it relates, and indicates the number of the paragraph in which this appears. This facilitates cross-reference between the text and the notes, while making it possible for readers to study the notes without repeatedly consulting the text, if they so prefer. It is hoped in this way to meet the needs of readers of a wide range of backgrounds and interests.\nThe index provides a guide to subjects in all sections of the volume.\nThe significance and character of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas and the range of subjects it contains have been graphically depicted by Shoghi Effendi in his history of the first Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed century entitled God Passes By. As an assistance to the reader, these passages are provided in the section that immediately follows the introduction. The Synopsis and Codification, which is republished in this volume, serves as another aid for obtaining an overview of the Book. \n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\n\nThis year, the 149th of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed era, marks the Centenary of the Ascension of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, Bearer of the universal Revelation of God destined to lead humanity to its collective coming of age. That this occasion should be observed by a community of believers representing a cross-section of the entire human race and established, in the course of a century and a half, in the most remote corners of the globe, is a token of the forces of unity released by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s advent.

That this occasion should be observed by a community of believers representing a cross-section of the entire human race and established, in the course of a century and a half, in the most remote corners of the globe, is a token of the forces of unity released by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s advent. A further testimony to the operation of these same forces can be seen in the extent to which Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s vision has prefigured contemporary human experience in so many of its aspects. It is a propitious moment for the publication of this first authorized translation into English of the Mother Book of His Revelation, His \u201cMost Holy Book,\u201d the Book in which He sets forth the Laws of God for a Dispensation destined to endure for no less than a thousand years.\nOf the more than one hundred volumes comprising the sacred Writings of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas is of unique importance. \u201cTo build anew the whole world\u201d is the claim and challenge of His Message, and the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas is the Charter of the future world civilization that Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h has come to raise up. Its provisions rest squarely on the foundation established by past religions, for, in the words of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, \u201cThis is the changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal in the future.\u201d In this Revelation the concepts of the past are brought to a new level of understanding, and the social laws, changed to suit the age now dawning, are designed to carry humanity forward into a world civilization the splendors of which can as yet be scarcely imagined.\nIn its affirmation of the validity of the great religions of the past, the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas reiterates those eternal truths enunciated by all the Divine Messengers: the unity of God, love of one\u2019s neighbor, and the moral purpose of earthly life. At the same time it removes those elements of past religious codes that now constitute obstacles to the emerging unification of the world and the reconstruction of human society.\nThe Law of God for this Dispensation addresses the needs of the entire human family. There are laws in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas which are directed primarily to the members of a specific section of humanity and can be immediately understood by them but which, at first reading, may be obscure to people of a different culture. Such, for example, is the law prohibiting the confession of sins to a fellow human being which, though understandable by those of Christian background, may puzzle others. Many laws relate to those of past Dispensations, especially the two most recent ones, those of Mu\u1e25ammad and the B\u00e1b embodied in the Qur\u2019\u00e1n and the Bay\u00e1n. Nevertheless, although certain ordinances of the Aqdas have such a focused reference, they also have universal implications. Through His Law, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h gradually unveils the significance of the new levels of knowledge and behavior to which the peoples of the world are being called. He embeds His precepts in a setting of spiritual commentary, keeping ever before the mind of the reader the principle that these laws, no matter the subject with which they deal, serve the manifold purposes of bringing tranquillity to human society, raising the standard of human behavior, increasing the range of human understanding, and spiritualizing the life of each and all. Throughout, it is the relationship of the individual soul to God and the fulfillment of its spiritual destiny that is the ultimate aim of the laws of religion. \u201cThink not,\u201d is Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s own assertion, \u201cthat We have revealed unto you a mere code of laws. Nay, rather, We have unsealed the choice Wine with the fingers of might and power.\u201d His Book of Laws is His \u201cweightiest testimony unto all people, and the proof of the All-Merciful unto all who are in heaven and all who are on earth.\u201d\nAn introduction to the spiritual universe unveiled in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas would fail in its purpose if it did not acquaint the reader with the interpretive and legislative institutions that Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h has indissolubly linked with the system of law thus revealed. At the foundation of this guidance lies the unique role which Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s Writings\u2014indeed the text of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas itself\u2014confer on His eldest son, \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa9c4e7d-56bd-4dc0-933f-5037c78ee95c": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa9c4e7d-56bd-4dc0-933f-5037c78ee95c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "844abeca-a0e8-42a4-8b2d-6caf622a8ac8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "6bd77545825f4671b13ada538536357190c05de02870b9193d626817f4761659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dcd1ebea-2ba6-41f5-919b-1032f343413d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "8fd7cc1d355dfb8d69c05e1c2945303ddbeae10b0bb723bbbac2ba7c75813e53", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "21253608-662e-406f-9415-60627d0f8ebe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "155ed489cdfc7fbc6e4c4045d83441dea8a2e456115887c95a686ba74f08c164", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b35d5d1b2bbe65c53352145c25fd4bd0e5e491b22e747c4d9e72fae25eb31a01", "text": "\u201cThink not,\u201d is Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s own assertion, \u201cthat We have revealed unto you a mere code of laws.

At the foundation of this guidance lies the unique role which Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s Writings\u2014indeed the text of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas itself\u2014confer on His eldest son, \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1. This unique figure is at once the Exemplar of the pattern of life taught by His Father, the divinely inspired authoritative Interpreter of His Teachings and the Center and Pivot of the Covenant which the Author of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Revelation made with all who recognize Him. The twenty-nine years of \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1\u2019s ministry endowed the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed world with a luminous body of commentary that opens multiple vistas of understanding on His Father\u2019s purpose.\nIn His Will and Testament \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 conferred the mantle of Guardian of the Cause and infallible Interpreter of its teachings upon His eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, and confirmed the authority and guarantee of divine guidance decreed by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h for the Universal House of Justice on all matters \u201cwhich have not outwardly been revealed in the Book.\u201d The Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice can thus be seen to be, in the words of Shoghi Effendi, the \u201cTwin Successors\u201d of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h and \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1. They are the supreme institutions of the Administrative Order which was founded and anticipated in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas and elaborated by \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 in His Will.\nDuring the thirty-six years of his ministry, Shoghi Effendi raised up the structure of elected Spiritual Assemblies\u2014the Houses of Justice referred to in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas, now in their embryonic stage\u2014and with their collaboration initiated the systematic implementation of the Divine Plan that \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 had laid out for the diffusion of the Faith throughout the world. He also set in motion, on the basis of the strong administrative structure that had been established, the processes which were an essential preparation for the election of the Universal House of Justice. This body, which came into existence in April 1963, is elected through secret ballot and plurality vote in a three-stage election by adult Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds throughout the world. The revealed Word of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, together with the interpretations and expositions of the Center of the Covenant and the Guardian of the Cause, constitute the binding terms of reference of the Universal House of Justice and are its bedrock foundation.\nAs to the laws themselves, a careful scrutiny discloses that they govern three areas: the individual\u2019s relationship to God, physical and spiritual matters which benefit the individual directly, and relations among individuals and between the individual and society. They can be grouped under the following headings: prayer and fasting; laws of personal status governing marriage, divorce and inheritance; a range of other laws, ordinances and prohibitions, as well as exhortations; and the abrogation of specific laws and ordinances of previous Dispensations.

They can be grouped under the following headings: prayer and fasting; laws of personal status governing marriage, divorce and inheritance; a range of other laws, ordinances and prohibitions, as well as exhortations; and the abrogation of specific laws and ordinances of previous Dispensations. A salient characteristic is their brevity. They constitute the kernel of a vast range of law that will arise in centuries to come. This elaboration of the law will be enacted by the Universal House of Justice under the authority conferred upon it by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h Himself. In one of His Tablets \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 elucidates this principle:\n\n\nThose matters of major importance which constitute the foundation of the Law of God are explicitly recorded in the Text, but subsidiary laws are left to the House of Justice. The wisdom of this is that the times never remain the same, for change is a necessary quality and an essential attribute of this world, and of time and place. Therefore the House of Justice will take action accordingly\u2026\nBriefly, this is the wisdom of referring the laws of society to the House of Justice. In the religion of Isl\u00e1m, similarly, not every ordinance was explicitly revealed; nay not a tenth part of a tenth part was included in the Text; although all matters of major importance were specifically referred to, there were undoubtedly thousands of laws which were unspecified. These were devised by the divines of a later age according to the laws of Islamic jurisprudence, and individual divines made conflicting deductions from the original revealed ordinances. All these were enforced. Today this process of deduction is the right of the body of the House of Justice, and the deductions and conclusions of individual learned men have no authority, unless they are endorsed by the House of Justice. The difference is precisely this, that from the conclusions and endorsements of the body of the House of Justice whose members are elected by and known to the worldwide Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed community, no differences will arise; whereas the conclusions of individual divines and scholars would definitely lead to differences, and result in schism, division, and dispersion. The oneness of the Word would be destroyed, the unity of the Faith would disappear, and the edifice of the Faith of God would be shaken.\n\n\nAlthough the Universal House of Justice is explicitly authorized to change or repeal its own legislation as conditions change, thus providing Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed law with an essential element of flexibility, it cannot abrogate or change any of the laws which are explicitly laid down in the sacred Text.\nThe society for which certain of the laws of the Aqdas are designed will come only gradually into being, and Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h has provided for the progressive application of Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed law:\n\n\nIndeed, the laws of God are like unto the ocean and the children of men as fish, did they but know it. However, in observing them one must exercise tact and wisdom\u2026 Since most people are feeble and far-removed from the purpose of God, therefore one must observe tact and prudence under all conditions, so that nothing might happen that could cause disturbance and dissension or raise clamor among the heedless. Verily, His bounty hath surpassed the whole universe and His bestowals encompassed all that dwell on earth. One must guide mankind to the ocean of true understanding in a spirit of love and tolerance. The Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas itself beareth eloquent testimony to the loving providence of God.\n\n\nThe principle governing this progressive application was enunciated in a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to a National Spiritual Assembly in 1935:\n\n\n\u2026 the laws revealed by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h in the Aqdas are, whenever practicable and not in direct conflict with the Civil Law of the land, absolutely binding on every believer or Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed institution whether in the East or in the West. Certain laws \u2026 should be regarded by all believers as universally and vitally applicable at the present time. Others have been formulated in anticipation of a state of society destined to emerge from the chaotic conditions that prevail today\u2026 What has not been formulated in the Aqdas, in addition to matters of detail and of secondary importance arising out of the application of the laws already formulated by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, will have to be enacted by the Universal House of Justice. This body can supplement but never invalidate or modify in the least degree what has already been formulated by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h. Nor has the Guardian any right whatsoever to lessen the binding effect much less to abrogate the provisions of so fundamental and sacred a Book.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0010e30-fdd1-4410-ae2f-399f7b7ad0c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0010e30-fdd1-4410-ae2f-399f7b7ad0c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "844abeca-a0e8-42a4-8b2d-6caf622a8ac8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "6bd77545825f4671b13ada538536357190c05de02870b9193d626817f4761659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "21253608-662e-406f-9415-60627d0f8ebe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "155ed489cdfc7fbc6e4c4045d83441dea8a2e456115887c95a686ba74f08c164", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "efbc6850-3730-42e4-9f4d-278da691c4a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "c010bce4a872ecf64d2feda6b8d37ef88657a6245094469969974d6eaa4d5ef8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1ffa633666cd5e77c48ca4bb0ef0d861efaf7ce30f66117b9d075a0638682aad", "text": "The number of laws binding on Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds is not increased by the publication of this translation. When it is deemed timely, the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed community will be advised which additional laws are binding upon believers, and any guidance or supplementary legislation necessary for their application will be provided.\nIn general, the laws of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas are stated succinctly. An example of this conciseness can be seen in the fact that many are expressed only as they apply to a man, but it is apparent from the Guardian\u2019s writings that, where Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h has given a law as between a man and a woman, it applies mutatis mutandis between a woman and a man unless the context makes this impossible. For example, the text of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas forbids a man to marry his father\u2019s wife (i.e. his stepmother), and the Guardian has indicated that likewise a woman is forbidden to marry her stepfather. This understanding of the implications of the Law has far-reaching effects in light of the fundamental Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed principle of the equality of the sexes, and should be borne in mind when the sacred Text is studied. That men and women differ from one another in certain characteristics and functions is an inescapable fact of nature and makes possible their complementary roles in certain areas of the life of society; but it is significant that \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 has stated that in this Dispensation \u201cEquality of men and women, except in some negligible instances, has been fully and categorically announced.\u201d\nMention has already been made of the intimate relationship between the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas and the Holy Books of previous Dispensations. Especially close is the relationship to the Bay\u00e1n, the Book of Laws revealed by the B\u00e1b. It is elucidated in the following excerpts from letters written on behalf of the Guardian:\n\n\nShoghi Effendi feels that the unity of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Revelation as one complete whole embracing the Faith of the B\u00e1b should be emphasized\u2026 The Faith of the B\u00e1b should not be divorced from that of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h. Though the teachings of the Bay\u00e1n have been abrogated and superseded by the laws of the Aqdas, yet due to the fact that the B\u00e1b considered Himself as the Forerunner of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, we would regard His Dispensation together with that of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h as forming one entity, the former being introductory to the advent of the latter.\nThe B\u00e1b states that His laws are provisional and depend upon the acceptance of the future Manifestation. This is why in the Book of Aqdas Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h sanctions some of the laws found in the Bay\u00e1n, modifies others and sets aside many.\n\n\nJust as the Bay\u00e1n had been revealed by the B\u00e1b at about the midpoint of His Ministry, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h revealed the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas around 1873, some twenty years after He had received, in the S\u00edy\u00e1h-Ch\u00e1l of \u1e6cihr\u00e1n, the intimation of His Revelation. In one of His Tablets He indicates that even after its revelation the Aqdas was withheld by Him for some time before it was sent to the friends in Iran. Thereafter, as Shoghi Effendi has related:\n\n\nThe formulation by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, in His Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas, of the fundamental laws of His Dispensation was followed, as His Mission drew to a close, by the enunciation of certain precepts and principles which lie at the very core of His Faith, by the reaffirmation of truths He had previously proclaimed, by the elaboration and elucidation of some of the laws He had already laid down, by the revelation of further prophecies and warnings, and by the establishment of subsidiary ordinances designed to supplement the provisions of His Most Holy Book. These were recorded in unnumbered Tablets, which He continued to reveal until the last days of His earthly life\u2026\n\n\nAmong such works is the Questions and Answers, a compilation made by Zaynu\u2019l-Muqarrab\u00edn, the most eminent of the transcribers of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s Writings. Consisting of answers revealed by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h to questions put to Him by various believers, it constitutes an invaluable appendix to the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas. In 1978 the most noteworthy of the other Tablets of this nature were published in English as a compilation entitled Tablets of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h revealed after the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas.\nSome years after the revelation of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h had manuscript copies sent to Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds in Iran, and in the year 1308 A.H.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "efbc6850-3730-42e4-9f4d-278da691c4a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "efbc6850-3730-42e4-9f4d-278da691c4a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "844abeca-a0e8-42a4-8b2d-6caf622a8ac8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "6bd77545825f4671b13ada538536357190c05de02870b9193d626817f4761659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a0010e30-fdd1-4410-ae2f-399f7b7ad0c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "1ffa633666cd5e77c48ca4bb0ef0d861efaf7ce30f66117b9d075a0638682aad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e7f80ef3-ee05-4319-8581-2c470550d3da", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "0b73b277a62bb8d882c28806ac2dddf3978ee6fe2540fe2da37ecdc9fc8a85bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c010bce4a872ecf64d2feda6b8d37ef88657a6245094469969974d6eaa4d5ef8", "text": "Among such works is the Questions and Answers, a compilation made by Zaynu\u2019l-Muqarrab\u00edn, the most eminent of the transcribers of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s Writings.

(1890\u201391 A.D.), towards the end of His life, He arranged for the publication of the original Arabic text of the Book in Bombay.\nA word should be said about the style of language in which the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas has been rendered into English. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h enjoyed a superb mastery of Arabic, and preferred to use it in those Tablets and other Writings where its precision of meaning was particularly appropriate to the exposition of basic principle. Beyond the choice of language itself, however, the style employed is of an exalted and emotive character, immensely compelling, particularly to those familiar with the great literary tradition out of which it arose. In taking up his task of translation, Shoghi Effendi faced the challenge of finding an English style which would not only faithfully convey the exactness of the text\u2019s meaning, but would also evoke in the reader the spirit of meditative reverence which is a distinguishing feature of response to the original. The form of expression he selected, reminiscent of the style used by the seventeenth-century translators of the Bible, captures the elevated mode of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s Arabic, while remaining accessible to the contemporary reader. His translations, moreover, are illumined by his uniquely inspired understanding of the purport and implications of the originals.\nAlthough both Arabic and English are languages with rich vocabularies and varied modes of expression, their forms differ widely from one another. The Arabic of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas is marked by intense concentration and terseness of expression. It is a characteristic of this style that if a connotation is obvious it should not be explicitly stated. This presents a problem for a reader whose cultural, religious and literary background is entirely different from that of Arabic. A literal translation of a passage which is clear in the Arabic could be obscure in English. It therefore becomes necessary to include in the English translation of such passages that element of the Arabic sentence which is obviously implicit in the original. At the same time, it is vital to avoid extrapolating this process to the point where it would add unjustifiably to the original or limit its meaning. Striking the right balance between beauty and clarity of expression on the one hand, and literalness on the other, is one of the major issues with which the translators have had to grapple and which has caused repeated reconsideration of the rendering of certain passages. Another major issue is the legal implication of certain Arabic terms which have a range of meanings different from those of similar terms in English.\nSacred Scripture clearly requires especial care and faithfulness in translation. This is supremely important in the case of a Book of Laws, where it is vital that the reader not be misled or drawn into fruitless disputation. As had been foreseen, the translation of the Most Holy Book has been a work of the utmost difficulty, requiring consultation with experts in many lands. Since some one-third of the text had already been translated by Shoghi Effendi, it was necessary to strive for three qualities in the translation of the remaining passages: accuracy of meaning, beauty of English, and conformity of style with that used by Shoghi Effendi.\nWe are now satisfied that the translation has reached a point where it represents an acceptable rendering of the original.

Its peoples, of whatever race, nation, or religion, are being challenged to subordinate all lesser loyalties and limiting identities to their oneness as citizens of a single planetary homeland. In Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s words: \u201cThe well-being of mankind, its peace and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established.\u201d May the publication of this translation of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas lend a fresh impulse to the realization of this universal vision, opening vistas of a worldwide regeneration.\n\n\nThe Universal House of Justice\n\n\n\nA Description of the \nKit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas by \nShoghi Effendi\n\n\nTaken from God Passes By, \nhis history of the first Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed century\n\n\nUnique and stupendous as was this Proclamation, it proved to be but a prelude to a still mightier revelation of the creative power of its Author, and to what may well rank as the most signal act of His ministry\u2014the promulgation of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas. Alluded to in the Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n, the principal repository of that Law which the Prophet Isaiah had anticipated, and which the writer of the Apocalypse had described as the \u201cnew heaven\u201d and the \u201cnew earth,\u201d as \u201cthe Tabernacle of God,\u201d as the \u201cHoly City,\u201d as the \u201cBride,\u201d the \u201cNew Jerusalem coming down from God,\u201d this \u201cMost Holy Book,\u201d whose provisions must remain inviolate for no less than a thousand years, and whose system will embrace the entire planet, may well be regarded as the brightest emanation of the mind of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, as the Mother Book of His Dispensation, and the Charter of His New World Order.\nRevealed soon after Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h had been transferred to the house of \u2018\u00dad\u00ed Khamm\u00e1r (circa 1873), at a time when He was still encompassed by the tribulations that had afflicted Him, through the acts committed by His enemies and the professed adherents of His Faith, this Book, this treasury enshrining the priceless gems of His Revelation, stands out, by virtue of the principles it inculcates, the administrative institutions it ordains and the function with which it invests the appointed Successor of its Author, unique and incomparable among the world\u2019s sacred Scriptures. For, unlike the Old Testament and the Holy Books which preceded it, in which the actual precepts uttered by the Prophet Himself are nonexistent; unlike the Gospels, in which the few sayings attributed to Jesus Christ afford no clear guidance regarding the future administration of the affairs of His Faith; unlike even the Qur\u2019\u00e1n which, though explicit in the laws and ordinances formulated by the Apostle of God, is silent on the all-important subject of the succession, the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas, revealed from first to last by the Author of the Dispensation Himself, not only preserves for posterity the basic laws and ordinances on which the fabric of His future World Order must rest, but ordains, in addition to the function of interpretation which it confers upon His Successor, the necessary institutions through which the integrity and unity of His Faith can alone be safeguarded.\nIn this Charter of the future world civilization its Author\u2014at once the Judge, the Lawgiver, the Unifier and Redeemer of mankind\u2014announces to the kings of the earth the promulgation of the \u201cMost Great Law\u201d; pronounces them to be His vassals; proclaims Himself the \u201cKing of Kings\u201d; disclaims any intention of laying hands on their kingdoms; reserves for Himself the right to \u201cseize and possess the hearts of men\u201d; warns the world\u2019s ecclesiastical leaders not to weigh the \u201cBook of God\u201d with such standards as are current amongst them; and affirms that the Book itself is the \u201cUnerring Balance\u201d established amongst men.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff1d001e-6899-4245-87f4-41adf6c120f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff1d001e-6899-4245-87f4-41adf6c120f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "844abeca-a0e8-42a4-8b2d-6caf622a8ac8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "6bd77545825f4671b13ada538536357190c05de02870b9193d626817f4761659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7f80ef3-ee05-4319-8581-2c470550d3da", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "0b73b277a62bb8d882c28806ac2dddf3978ee6fe2540fe2da37ecdc9fc8a85bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "485ab22f-6008-4199-b929-ac38bbbc3e80", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "28d3b0e6ce1c6c1a3ede4978827b110d7517cf4cb122ebbd0fbc802d7786f354", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "97af10ca3c0de2073a19cb2878c9a918137b1355fed2fd498e0ecc902dfdd94e", "text": "In this Charter of the future world civilization its Author\u2014at once the Judge, the Lawgiver, the Unifier and Redeemer of mankind\u2014announces to the kings of the earth the promulgation of the \u201cMost Great Law\u201d; pronounces them to be His vassals; proclaims Himself the \u201cKing of Kings\u201d; disclaims any intention of laying hands on their kingdoms; reserves for Himself the right to \u201cseize and possess the hearts of men\u201d; warns the world\u2019s ecclesiastical leaders not to weigh the \u201cBook of God\u201d with such standards as are current amongst them; and affirms that the Book itself is the \u201cUnerring Balance\u201d established amongst men.

Neither is acceptable without the other.

The seas of Divine wisdom and Divine utterance have risen under the breath of the breeze of the All-Merciful. Hasten to drink your fill, O men of understanding! They that have violated the Covenant of God by breaking His commandments, and have turned back on their heels, these have erred grievously in the sight of God, the All-Possessing, the Most High.\nO ye peoples of the world! Know assuredly that My commandments are the lamps of My loving providence among My servants, and the keys of My mercy for My creatures.

Were any man to taste the sweetness of the words which the lips of the All-Merciful have willed to utter, he would, though the treasures of the earth be in his possession, renounce them one and all, that he might vindicate the truth of even one of His commandments, shining above the Dayspring of His bountiful care and loving-kindness.\nSay: From My laws the sweet-smelling savor of My garment can be smelled, and by their aid the standards of Victory will be planted upon the highest peaks. The Tongue of My power hath, from the heaven of My omnipotent glory, addressed to My creation these words: \u201cObserve My commandments, for the love of My beauty.\u201d Happy is the lover that hath inhaled the divine fragrance of his Best-Beloved from these words, laden with the perfume of a grace which no tongue can describe. By My life! He who hath drunk the choice wine of fairness from the hands of My bountiful favor will circle around My commandments that shine above the Dayspring of My creation.\nThink not that We have revealed unto you a mere code of laws. Nay, rather, We have unsealed the choice Wine with the fingers of might and power. To this beareth witness that which the Pen of Revelation hath revealed.

God hath granted you leave to prostrate yourselves on any surface that is clean, for We have removed in this regard the limitation that had been laid down in the Book; God, indeed, hath knowledge of that whereof ye know naught.

Perform ye, likewise, ablutions for the Obligatory Prayer; this is the command of God, the Incomparable, the Unrestrained.\nYe have been forbidden to commit murder or adultery, or to engage in backbiting or calumny; shun ye, then, what hath been prohibited in the holy Books and Tablets.\nWe have divided inheritance into seven categories: to the children, We have allotted nine parts comprising five hundred and forty shares; to the wife, eight parts comprising four hundred and eighty shares; to the father, seven parts comprising four hundred and twenty shares; to the mother, six parts comprising three hundred and sixty shares; to the brothers, five parts or three hundred shares; to the sisters, four parts or two hundred and forty shares; and to the teachers, three parts or one hundred and eighty shares. Such was the ordinance of My Forerunner, He Who extolleth My Name in the night season and at the break of day. When We heard the clamor of the children as yet unborn, We doubled their share and decreased those of the rest. He, of a truth, hath power to ordain whatsoever He desireth, and He doeth as He pleaseth by virtue of His sovereign might.\nShould the deceased leave no offspring, their share shall revert to the House of Justice, to be expended by the Trustees of the All-Merciful on the orphaned and widowed, and on whatsoever will bring benefit to the generality of the people, that all may give thanks unto their Lord, the All-Gracious, the Pardoner.\nShould the deceased leave offspring, but none of the other categories of heirs that have been specified in the Book, they shall receive two-thirds of the inheritance and the remaining third shall revert to the House of Justice. Such is the command which hath been given, in majesty and glory, by Him Who is the All-Possessing, the Most High.\nIf the deceased should leave none of the specified heirs, but have among his relatives nephews and nieces, whether on his brother\u2019s or his sister\u2019s side, two-thirds of the inheritance shall pass to them; or, lacking these, to his uncles and aunts on both his father\u2019s and his mother\u2019s side, and after them to their sons and daughters. The remaining third of the inheritance shall, in any case, revert to the Seat of Justice. Thus hath it been laid down in the Book by Him Who ruleth over all men.\nShould the deceased be survived by none of those whose names have been recorded by the Pen of the Most High, his estate shall, in its entirety, revert to the aforementioned Seat that it may be expended on that which is prescribed by God. He, verily, is the Ordainer, the Omnipotent.\nWe have assigned the residence and personal clothing of the deceased to the male, not female, offspring, nor to the other heirs. He, verily, is the Munificent, the All-Bountiful.\nShould the son of the deceased have passed away in the days of his father and have left children, they will inherit their father\u2019s share, as prescribed in the Book of God. Divide ye their share amongst them with perfect justice.

As for what We have appropriated to the children, this is a bounty conferred on them by God, that they may render thanks unto their Lord, the Compassionate, the Merciful. These, verily, are the Laws of God; transgress them not at the prompting of your base and selfish desires. Observe ye the injunctions laid upon you by Him Who is the Dawning-place of Utterance. The sincere among His servants will regard the precepts set forth by God as the Water of Life to the followers of every faith, and the Lamp of wisdom and loving providence to all the denizens of earth and heaven.\nThe Lord hath ordained that in every city a House of Justice be established wherein shall gather counselors to the number of Bah\u00e1, and should it exceed this number it doth not matter. They should consider themselves as entering the Court of the presence of God, the Exalted, the Most High, and as beholding Him Who is the Unseen. It behooveth them to be the trusted ones of the Merciful among men and to regard themselves as the guardians appointed of God for all that dwell on earth. It is incumbent upon them to take counsel together and to have regard for the interests of the servants of God, for His sake, even as they regard their own interests, and to choose that which is meet and seemly.

Hold ye fast unto the cord of means and place your trust in God, the Provider of all means.\nThe kissing of hands hath been forbidden in the Book. This practice is prohibited by God, the Lord of glory and command. To none is it permitted to seek absolution from another soul; let repentance be between yourselves and God.

Say: What manner of man art thou, O vain and heedless one, who wouldst appear as other than thou art? And among the people is he who layeth claim to inner knowledge, and still deeper knowledge concealed within this knowledge. Say: Thou speakest false! By God! What thou dost possess is naught but husks which We have left to thee as bones are left to dogs. By the righteousness of the one true God! Were anyone to wash the feet of all mankind, and were he to worship God in the forests, valleys, and mountains, upon high hills and lofty peaks, to leave no rock or tree, no clod of earth, but was a witness to his worship\u2014yet, should the fragrance of My good pleasure not be inhaled from him, his works would never be acceptable unto God. Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the Lord of all. How many a man hath secluded himself in the climes of India, denied himself the things that God hath decreed as lawful, imposed upon himself austerities and mortifications, and hath not been remembered by God, the Revealer of Verses. Make not your deeds as snares wherewith to entrap the object of your aspiration, and deprive not yourselves of this Ultimate Objective for which have ever yearned all such as have drawn nigh unto God. Say: The very life of all deeds is My good pleasure, and all things depend upon Mine acceptance. Read ye the Tablets that ye may know what hath been purposed in the Books of God, the All-Glorious, the Ever-Bounteous. He who attaineth to My love hath title to a throne of gold, to sit thereon in honor over all the world; he who is deprived thereof, though he sit upon the dust, that dust would seek refuge with God, the Lord of all Religions.\nWhoso layeth claim to a Revelation direct from God, ere the expiration of a full thousand years, such a man is assuredly a lying impostor.

This is that of which We gave you forewarning when We were dwelling in \u2018Ir\u00e1q, then later while in the Land of Mystery, and now from this Resplendent Spot.\nBe not dismayed, O peoples of the world, when the daystar of My beauty is set, and the heaven of My tabernacle is concealed from your eyes. Arise to further My Cause, and to exalt My Word amongst men. We are with you at all times, and shall strengthen you through the power of truth. We are truly almighty. Whoso hath recognized Me will arise and serve Me with such determination that the powers of earth and heaven shall be unable to defeat his purpose.\nThe peoples of the world are fast asleep. Were they to wake from their slumber, they would hasten with eagerness unto God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. They would cast away everything they possess, be it all the treasures of the earth, that their Lord may remember them to the extent of addressing to them but one word. Such is the instruction given you by Him Who holdeth the knowledge of things hidden, in a Tablet which the eye of creation hath not seen, and which is revealed to none except His own Self, the omnipotent Protector of all worlds. So bewildered are they in the drunkenness of their evil desires, that they are powerless to recognize the Lord of all being, Whose voice calleth aloud from every direction: \u201cThere is none other God but Me, the Mighty, the All-Wise.\u201d\nSay: Rejoice not in the things ye possess; tonight they are yours, tomorrow others will possess them. Thus warneth you He Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Say: Can ye claim that what ye own is lasting or secure? Nay! By Myself, the All-Merciful, ye cannot, if ye be of them who judge fairly. The days of your life flee away as a breath of wind, and all your pomp and glory shall be folded up as were the pomp and glory of those gone before you. Reflect, O people! What hath become of your bygone days, your lost centuries? Happy the days that have been consecrated to the remembrance of God, and blessed the hours which have been spent in praise of Him Who is the All-Wise. By My life! Neither the pomp of the mighty, nor the wealth of the rich, nor even the ascendancy of the ungodly will endure. All will perish, at a word from Him. He, verily, is the All-Powerful, the All-Compelling, the Almighty. What advantage is there in the earthly things which men possess? That which shall profit them, they have utterly neglected. Erelong, they will awake from their slumber, and find themselves unable to obtain that which hath escaped them in the days of their Lord, the Almighty, the All-Praised. Did they but know it, they would renounce their all, that their names may be mentioned before His throne.

Such is the command which hath, through the power of truth, been made manifest from the heaven of Revelation.\nIt hath been laid down in the Bay\u00e1n that marriage is dependent upon the consent of both parties. Desiring to establish love, unity and harmony amidst Our servants, We have conditioned it, once the couple\u2019s wish is known, upon the permission of their parents, lest enmity and rancor should arise amongst them. And in this We have yet other purposes. Thus hath Our commandment been ordained.\nNo marriage may be contracted without payment of a dowry, which hath been fixed for city dwellers at nineteen mithq\u00e1ls of pure gold, and for village dwellers at the same amount in silver. Whoso wisheth to increase this sum, it is forbidden him to exceed the limit of ninety-five mithq\u00e1ls. Thus hath the command been writ in majesty and power. If he content himself, however, with a payment of the lowest level, it shall be better for him according to the Book. God, verily, enricheth whomsoever He willeth through both heavenly and earthly means, and He, in truth, hath power over all things.\nIt hath been decreed by God that, should any one of His servants intend to travel, he must fix for his wife a time when he will return home. If he return by the promised time, he will have obeyed the bidding of his Lord and shall be numbered by the Pen of His behest among the righteous; otherwise, if there be good reason for delay, he must inform his wife and make the utmost endeavor to return to her. Should neither of these eventualities occur, it behooveth her to wait for a period of nine months, after which there is no impediment to her taking another husband; but should she wait longer, God, verily, loveth those women and men who show forth patience. Obey ye My commandments, and follow not the ungodly, they who have been reckoned as sinners in God\u2019s Holy Tablet. If, during the period of her waiting, word should reach her from her husband, she should choose the course that is praiseworthy. He, of a truth, desireth that His servants and His handmaids should be at peace with one another; take heed lest ye do aught that may provoke intransigence amongst you.

If, however, news should reach her of her husband\u2019s death or murder, and be confirmed by general report, or by the testimony of two just witnesses, it behooveth her to remain single; then, upon completion of the fixed number of months, she is free to adopt the course of her choosing. Such is the bidding of Him Who is mighty and powerful in His command.\nShould resentment or antipathy arise between husband and wife, he is not to divorce her but to bide in patience throughout the course of one whole year, that perchance the fragrance of affection may be renewed between them. If, upon the completion of this period, their love hath not returned, it is permissible for divorce to take place. God\u2019s wisdom, verily, hath encompassed all things. The Lord hath prohibited, in a Tablet inscribed by the Pen of His command, the practice to which ye formerly had recourse when thrice ye had divorced a woman. This He hath done as a favor on His part, that ye may be accounted among the thankful. He who hath divorced his wife may choose, upon the passing of each month, to remarry her when there is mutual affection and consent, so long as she hath not taken another husband. Should she have wed again, then, by this other union, the separation is confirmed and the matter is concluded unless, clearly, her circumstances change. Thus hath the decree been inscribed with majesty in this glorious Tablet by Him Who is the Dawning-place of Beauty.\nIf the wife accompany her husband on a journey, and differences arise between them on the way, he is required to provide her with her expenses for one whole year, and either to return her whence she came or to entrust her, together with the necessaries for her journey, to a dependable person who is to escort her home. Thy Lord, verily, ordaineth as He pleaseth, by virtue of a sovereignty that overshadoweth the peoples of the earth.\nShould a woman be divorced in consequence of a proven act of infidelity, she shall receive no maintenance during her period of waiting. Thus hath the daystar of Our commandment shone forth resplendent from the firmament of justice. Truly, the Lord loveth union and harmony and abhorreth separation and divorce. Live ye one with another, O people, in radiance and joy. By My life! All that are on earth shall pass away, while good deeds alone shall endure; to the truth of My words God doth Himself bear witness. Compose your differences, O My servants; then heed ye the admonition of Our Pen of Glory and follow not the arrogant and wayward.\nTake heed lest the world beguile you as it beguiled the people who went before you! Observe ye the statutes and precepts of your Lord, and walk ye in this Way which hath been laid out before you in righteousness and truth. They who eschew iniquity and error, who adhere to virtue, are, in the sight of the one true God, among the choicest of His creatures; their names are extolled by the Concourse of the realms above, and by those who dwell in this Tabernacle which hath been raised in the name of God.\nIt is forbidden you to trade in slaves, be they men or women. It is not for him who is himself a servant to buy another of God\u2019s servants, and this hath been prohibited in His Holy Tablet. Thus, by His mercy, hath the commandment been recorded by the Pen of justice.

He, truly, is cognizant of what I say. Let none contend with another, and let no soul slay another; this, verily, is that which was forbidden you in a Book that hath lain concealed within the Tabernacle of glory. What!

Yield thanks unto Him with joy and radiance, and follow not such as are remote from the Dawning-place of His nearness.

The treasures ye have laid up have drawn you far away from your ultimate objective. This ill beseemeth you, could ye but understand it.

Say: By the one true God! Sinai is circling round the Dayspring of Revelation, while from the heights of the Kingdom the Voice of the Spirit of God is heard proclaiming: \u201cBestir yourselves, ye proud ones of the earth, and hasten ye unto Him.\u201d Carmel hath, in this Day, hastened in longing adoration to attain His court, whilst from the heart of Zion there cometh the cry: \u201cThe promise is fulfilled.

Arise, and serve Him Who is the Desire of all nations, Who hath created you through a word from Him, and ordained you to be, for all time, the emblems of His sovereignty.\nBy the righteousness of God! It is not Our wish to lay hands on your kingdoms. Our mission is to seize and possess the hearts of men. Upon them the eyes of Bah\u00e1 are fastened.

Whoso followeth his Lord will renounce the world and all that is therein; how much greater, then, must be the detachment of Him Who holdeth so august a station! Forsake your palaces, and haste ye to gain admittance into His Kingdom. This, indeed, will profit you both in this world and in the next.

He it is Who hath caused the Rock to shout, and the Burning Bush to lift up its voice, upon the Mount rising above the Holy Land, and proclaim: \u201cThe Kingdom is God\u2019s, the sovereign Lord of all, the All-Powerful, the Loving!\u201d\nWe have not entered any school, nor read any of your dissertations. Incline your ears to the words of this unlettered One, wherewith He summoneth you unto God, the Ever-Abiding. Better is this for you than all the treasures of the earth, could ye but comprehend it.\nWhoso interpreteth what hath been sent down from the heaven of Revelation, and altereth its evident meaning, he, verily, is of them that have perverted the Sublime Word of God, and is of the lost ones in the Lucid Book.\nIt hath been enjoined upon you to pare your nails, to bathe yourselves each week in water that covereth your bodies, and to clean yourselves with whatsoever ye have formerly employed. Take heed lest through negligence ye fail to observe that which hath been prescribed unto you by Him Who is the Incomparable, the Gracious. Immerse yourselves in clean water; it is not permissible to bathe yourselves in water that hath already been used. See that ye approach not the public pools of Persian baths; whoso maketh his way toward such baths will smell their fetid odor ere he entereth therein. Shun them, O people, and be not of those who ignominiously accept such vileness. In truth, they are as sinks of foulness and contamination, if ye be of them that apprehend. Avoid ye likewise the malodorous pools in the courtyards of Persian homes, and be ye of the pure and sanctified. Truly, We desire to behold you as manifestations of paradise on earth, that there may be diffused from you such fragrance as shall rejoice the hearts of the favored of God. If the bather, instead of entering the water, wash himself by pouring it upon his body, it shall be better for him and shall absolve him of the need for bodily immersion. The Lord, verily, hath willed, as a bounty from His presence, to make life easier for you that ye may be of those who are truly thankful.\nIt is forbidden you to wed your fathers\u2019 wives. We shrink, for very shame, from treating of the subject of boys. Fear ye the Merciful, O peoples of the world! Commit not that which is forbidden you in Our Holy Tablet, and be not of those who rove distractedly in the wilderness of their desires. \nTo none is it permitted to mutter sacred verses before the public gaze as he walketh in the street or marketplace; nay rather, if he wish to magnify the Lord, it behooveth him to do so in such places as have been erected for this purpose, or in his own home. This is more in keeping with sincerity and godliness. Thus hath the sun of Our commandment shone forth above the horizon of Our utterance.

The testator should head this document with the adornment of the Most Great Name, bear witness therein unto the oneness of God in the Dayspring of His Revelation, and make mention, as he may wish, of that which is praiseworthy, so that it may be a testimony for him in the kingdoms of Revelation and Creation and a treasure with his Lord, the Supreme Protector, the Faithful.\nAll Feasts have attained their consummation in the two Most Great Festivals, and in the two other Festivals that fall on the twin days\u2014the first of the Most Great Festivals being those days whereon the All-Merciful shed upon the whole of creation the effulgent glory of His most excellent Names and His most exalted Attributes, and the second being that day on which We raised up the One Who announced unto mankind the glad tidings of this Name, through which the dead have been resurrected and all who are in the heavens and on earth have been gathered together. Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the Ordainer, the Omniscient. \nHappy the one who entereth upon the first day of the month of Bah\u00e1, the day which God hath consecrated to this Great Name. And blessed be he who evidenceth on this day the bounties that God hath bestowed upon him; he, verily, is of those who show forth thanks to God through actions betokening the Lord\u2019s munificence which hath encompassed all the worlds. Say: This day, verily, is the crown of all the months and the source thereof, the day on which the breath of life is wafted over all created things. Great is the blessedness of him who greeteth it with radiance and joy. We testify that he is, in truth, among those who are blissful.\nSay: The Most Great Festival is, indeed, the King of Festivals. Call ye to mind, O people, the bounty which God hath conferred upon you. Ye were sunk in slumber, and lo! He aroused you by the reviving breezes of His Revelation, and made known unto you His manifest and undeviating Path.\nResort ye, in times of sickness, to competent physicians; We have not set aside the use of material means, rather have We confirmed it through this Pen, which God hath made to be the Dawning-place of His shining and glorious Cause.\nGod had formerly laid upon each one of the believers the duty of offering before Our throne priceless gifts from among his possessions.

But he whose words conflict with that which hath been sent down in My Holy Tablets is not of Me. Beware lest ye follow any impious pretender.

These are in truth seemly adornings unto the temple of man, if ye be of them that reflect. Cling, O ye people of Bah\u00e1, to the cord of servitude unto God, the True One, for thereby your stations shall be made manifest, your names written and preserved, your ranks raised and your memory exalted in the Preserved Tablet. Beware lest the dwellers on earth hinder you from this glorious and exalted station. Thus have We exhorted you in most of Our Epistles and now in this, Our Holy Tablet, above which hath beamed the Daystar of the Laws of the Lord, your God, the Powerful, the All-Wise.\nWhen the ocean of My presence hath ebbed and the Book of My Revelation is ended, turn your faces towards Him Whom God hath purposed, Who hath branched from this Ancient Root.\nConsider the pettiness of men\u2019s minds. They ask for that which injureth them, and cast away the thing that profiteth them. They are, indeed, of those that are far astray. We find some men desiring liberty, and priding themselves therein. Such men are in the depths of ignorance.\nLiberty must, in the end, lead to sedition, whose flames none can quench. Thus warneth you He Who is the Reckoner, the All-Knowing.

Say: The liberty that profiteth you is to be found nowhere except in complete servitude unto God, the Eternal Truth. Whoso hath tasted of its sweetness will refuse to barter it for all the dominion of earth and heaven.\nIn the Bay\u00e1n it had been forbidden you to ask Us questions. The Lord hath now relieved you of this prohibition, that ye may be free to ask what you need to ask, but not such idle questions as those on which the men of former times were wont to dwell. Fear God, and be ye of the righteous! Ask ye that which shall be of profit to you in the Cause of God and His dominion, for the portals of His tender compassion have been opened before all who dwell in heaven and on earth.\nThe number of months in a year, appointed in the Book of God, is nineteen. Of these the first hath been adorned with this Name which overshadoweth the whole of creation.\nThe Lord hath decreed that the dead should be interred in coffins made of crystal, of hard, resistant stone, or of wood that is both fine and durable, and that graven rings should be placed upon their fingers. He, verily, is the Supreme Ordainer, the One apprised of all.\nThe inscription on these rings should read, for men: \u201cUnto God belongeth all that is in the heavens and on the earth and whatsoever is between them, and He, in truth, hath knowledge of all things\u201d; and for women: \u201cUnto God belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is between them, and He, in truth, is potent over all things.\u201d These are the verses that were revealed aforetime, but lo, the Point of the Bay\u00e1n now calleth out, exclaiming, \u201cO Best-Beloved of the worlds! Reveal Thou in their stead such words as will waft the fragrance of Thy gracious favors over all mankind. We have announced unto everyone that one single word from Thee excelleth all that hath been sent down in the Bay\u00e1n. Thou, indeed, hast power to do what pleaseth Thee. Deprive not Thy servants of the overflowing bounties of the ocean of Thy mercy! Thou, in truth, art He Whose grace is infinite.\u201d Behold, We have hearkened to His call, and now fulfill His wish. He, verily, is the Best-Beloved, the Answerer of prayers. If the following verse, which hath at this moment been sent down by God, be engraved upon the burial rings of both men and women, it shall be better for them; We, of a certainty, are the Supreme Ordainer: \u201cI came forth from God, and return unto Him, detached from all save Him, holding fast to His Name, the Merciful, the Compassionate.\u201d Thus doth the Lord single out whomsoever He desireth for a bounty from His presence.

Take heed lest ye be prevented by aught that hath been recorded in the Book from hearkening unto this, the Living Book, Who proclaimeth the truth: \u201cVerily, there is no God but Me, the Most Excellent, the All-Praised.\u201d Look ye with the eye of equity upon Him Who hath descended from the heaven of Divine will and power, and be not of those who act unjustly.\nCall then to mind these words which have streamed forth, in tribute to this Revelation, from the Pen of Him Who was My Herald, and consider what the hands of the oppressors have wrought throughout My days.

Fear ye the Most Merciful and consider what He hath revealed in another passage. He said: \u201cThe Qiblih is indeed He Whom God will make manifest; whenever He moveth, it moveth, until He shall come to rest.\u201d Thus was it set down by the Supreme Ordainer when He desired to make mention of this Most Great Beauty. Meditate on this, O people, and be not of them that wander distraught in the wilderness of error. If ye reject Him at the bidding of your idle fancies, where then is the Qiblih to which ye will turn, O assemblage of the heedless? Ponder ye this verse, and judge equitably before God, that haply ye may glean the pearls of mysteries from the ocean that surgeth in My Name, the All-Glorious, the Most High.\nLet none, in this Day, hold fast to aught save that which hath been manifested in this Revelation. Such is the decree of God, aforetime and hereafter\u2014a decree wherewith the Scriptures of the Messengers of old have been adorned. Such is the admonition of the Lord, aforetime and hereafter\u2014an admonition wherewith the preamble to the Book of Life hath been embellished, did ye but perceive it. Such is the commandment of the Lord, aforetime and hereafter; beware lest ye choose instead the part of ignominy and abasement. Naught shall avail you in this Day but God, nor is there any refuge to flee to save Him, the Omniscient, the All-Wise. Whoso hath known Me hath known the Goal of all desire, and whoso hath turned unto Me hath turned unto the Object of all adoration. Thus hath it been set forth in the Book, and thus hath it been decreed by God, the Lord of all worlds. To read but one of the verses of My Revelation is better than to peruse the Scriptures of both the former and latter generations. This is the Utterance of the All-Merciful, would that ye had ears to hear! Say: This is the essence of knowledge, did ye but understand.\nAnd now consider what hath been revealed in yet another passage, that perchance ye may forsake your own concepts and set your faces towards God, the Lord of being. He4 hath said: \u201cIt is unlawful to enter into marriage save with a believer in the Bay\u00e1n. Should only one party to a marriage embrace this Cause, his or her possessions will become unlawful to the other, until such time as the latter hath converted. This law, however, will only take effect after the exaltation of the Cause of Him Whom We shall manifest in truth, or of that which hath already been made manifest in justice. Ere this, ye are at liberty to enter into wedlock as ye wish, that haply by this means ye may exalt the Cause of God.\u201d Thus hath the Nightingale sung with sweet melody upon the celestial bough, in praise of its Lord, the All-Merciful. Well is it with them that hearken.\nO people of the Bay\u00e1n, I adjure you by your Lord, the God of mercy, to look with the eye of fairness upon this utterance which hath been sent down through the power of truth, and not to be of those who see the testimony of God yet reject and deny it. They, in truth, are of those who will assuredly perish. The Point of the Bay\u00e1n hath explicitly made mention in this verse of the exaltation of My Cause before His own Cause; unto this will testify every just and understanding mind. As ye can readily witness in this day, its exaltation is such as none can deny save those whose eyes are drunken in this mortal life and whom a humiliating chastisement awaiteth in the life to come.\nSay: By the righteousness of God!

Such are the laws which God hath enjoined upon you, such His commandments prescribed unto you in His Holy Tablet; obey them with joy and gladness, for this is best for you, did ye but know.\nRecite ye the verses of God every morn and eventide. Whoso faileth to recite them hath not been faithful to the Covenant of God and His Testament, and whoso turneth away from these holy verses in this Day is of those who throughout eternity have turned away from God. Fear ye God, O My servants, one and all. Pride not yourselves on much reading of the verses or on a multitude of pious acts by night and day; for were a man to read a single verse with joy and radiance it would be better for him than to read with lassitude all the Holy Books of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Read ye the sacred verses in such measure that ye be not overcome by languor and despondency. Lay not upon your souls that which will weary them and weigh them down, but rather what will lighten and uplift them, so that they may soar on the wings of the Divine verses towards the Dawning-place of His manifest signs; this will draw you nearer to God, did ye but comprehend.\nTeach your children the verses revealed from the heaven of majesty and power, so that, in most melodious tones, they may recite the Tablets of the All-Merciful in the alcoves within the Mashriqu\u2019l-Adhk\u00e1rs. Whoever hath been transported by the rapture born of adoration for My Name, the Most Compassionate, will recite the verses of God in such wise as to captivate the hearts of those yet wrapped in slumber. Well is it with him who hath quaffed the Mystic Wine of everlasting life from the utterance of his merciful Lord in My Name\u2014a Name through which every lofty and majestic mountain hath been reduced to dust.\nYe have been enjoined to renew the furnishings of your homes after the passing of each nineteen years; thus hath it been ordained by One Who is Omniscient and All-Perceiving. He, verily, is desirous of refinement, both for you yourselves and for all that ye possess; lay not aside the fear of God and be not of the negligent. Whoso findeth that his means are insufficient to this purpose hath been excused by God, the Ever-Forgiving, the Most Bounteous. \nWash your feet once every day in summer, and once every three days during winter.\nShould anyone wax angry with you, respond to him with gentleness; and should anyone upbraid you, forbear to upbraid him in return, but leave him to himself and put your trust in God, the omnipotent Avenger, the Lord of might and justice.\nYe have been prohibited from making use of pulpits. Whoso wisheth to recite unto you the verses of his Lord, let him sit on a chair placed upon a dais, that he may make mention of God, his Lord, and the Lord of all mankind. It is pleasing to God that ye should seat yourselves on chairs and benches as a mark of honor for the love ye bear for Him and for the Manifestation of His glorious and resplendent Cause.\nGambling and the use of opium have been forbidden unto you.

He knoweth the inner secrets of the hearts and the meaning hidden in a mocker\u2019s wink. How many an embodiment of heedlessness who came unto Us with purity of heart have We established upon the seat of Our acceptance; and how many an exponent of wisdom have We in all justice consigned to the fire. We are, in truth, the One to judge.

Glorified be the All-Merciful, the Revealer of so inestimable a bounty. Say: Because He bore injustice, justice hath appeared on earth, and because He accepted abasement, the majesty of God hath shone forth amidst mankind.\nIt hath been forbidden you to carry arms unless essential, and permitted you to attire yourselves in silk. The Lord hath relieved you, as a bounty on His part, of the restrictions that formerly applied to clothing and to the trim of the beard. He, verily, is the Ordainer, the Omniscient.

With Us is the knowledge of all things, inscribed in a lucid Tablet. Sorrow not for that which hath befallen thee.

The most noteworthy of these have been published in Tablets of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h revealed after the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas. Included in this section is an extract from the Tablet of Ishr\u00e1q\u00e1t. The text of the three Obligatory Prayers referred to in Questions and Answers and the Prayer for the Dead mentioned in the Text are, likewise, reprinted here.\n*\nThe Tablet of Ishr\u00e1q\u00e1t\nThe Eighth Ishr\u00e1q\n\n\nThis passage, now written by the Pen of Glory, is accounted as part of the Most Holy Book: The men of God\u2019s House of Justice have been charged with the affairs of the people. They, in truth, are the Trustees of God among His servants and the daysprings of authority in His countries.\nO people of God! That which traineth the world is Justice, for it is upheld by two pillars, reward and punishment. These two pillars are the sources of life to the world. Inasmuch as for each day there is a new problem and for every problem an expedient solution, such affairs should be referred to the House of Justice that the members thereof may act according to the needs and requirements of the time. They that, for the sake of God, arise to serve His Cause, are the recipients of divine inspiration from the unseen Kingdom. It is incumbent upon all to be obedient unto them. All matters of State should be referred to the House of Justice, but acts of worship must be observed according to that which God hath revealed in His Book.\nO people of Bah\u00e1! Ye are the dawning-places of the love of God and the daysprings of His loving-kindness. Defile not your tongues with the cursing and reviling of any soul, and guard your eyes against that which is not seemly. Set forth that which ye possess. If it be favorably received, your end is attained; if not, to protest is vain. Leave that soul to himself and turn unto the Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting. Be not the cause of grief, much less of discord and strife. The hope is cherished that ye may obtain true education in the shelter of the tree of His tender mercies and act in accordance with that which God desireth. Ye are all the leaves of one tree and the drops of one ocean.\n(Tablets of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h revealed after the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas)\n*\nLong Obligatory Prayer\nTo be recited once in twenty-four hours\n\n\nWhoso wisheth to recite this prayer, let him stand up and turn unto God, and, as he standeth in his place, let him gaze to the right and to the left, as if awaiting the mercy of his Lord, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate.

If, however, he be unaware of this stipulation, she should abide in patience until such time as God shall please to disclose to her his fate. By the course that is praiseworthy in this connection is meant the exercise of patience.\n\n\n5. \nQuestion: Concerning the holy verse: \u201cWhen We heard the clamor of the children as yet unborn, We doubled their share and decreased those of the rest.\u201d\nAnswer: According to the Book of God, the estate of the deceased is divided into 2,520 shares, which number is the lowest common multiple of all integers up to nine, and these shares are then distributed into seven portions, each of which is allocated, as mentioned in the Book, to a particular category of heirs. The children, for example, are allotted nine blocks of 60 shares, comprising 540 shares in all. The meaning of the statement \u201cWe doubled their share\u201d is thus that the children receive a further nine blocks of 60 shares, entitling them to a total of 18 blocks all told. The extra shares that they receive are deducted from the portions of the other categories of heirs, so that, although it is revealed, for instance, that the spouse is entitled to \u201ceight parts comprising four hundred and eighty shares,\u201d which is the equivalent of eight blocks of 60 shares, now, by virtue of this rearrangement, one and a half blocks of shares, comprising 90 shares in all, have been subtracted from the spouse\u2019s portion and reallocated to the children, and similarly in the case of the others. The result is that the total amount subtracted is equivalent to the nine extra blocks of shares allotted to the children.\n\n\n6. \nQuestion: Is it necessary that the brother, in order to qualify for his portion of the inheritance, be descended from both the father and the mother of the deceased, or is it sufficient merely that there be one parent in common?\nAnswer: If the brother be descended from the father he shall receive his share of the inheritance in the prescribed measure recorded in the Book; but if he be descended from the mother, he shall receive only two-thirds of his entitlement, the remaining third reverting to the House of Justice.

This ruling is also applicable to the sister.\n\n\n7. \nQuestion: Amongst the provisions concerning inheritance it hath been laid down that, should the deceased leave no offspring, their share of the estate is to revert to the House of Justice. In the event of other categories of heirs, such as the father, mother, brother, sister and teacher being similarly absent, do their shares of the inheritance also revert to the House of Justice, or are they dealt with in some other fashion? \nAnswer: The sacred verse sufficeth. He saith, exalted be His Word: \u201cShould the deceased leave no offspring, their share shall revert to the House of Justice\u201d etc. and \u201cShould the deceased leave offspring, but none of the other categories of heirs that have been specified in the Book, they shall receive two-thirds of the inheritance and the remaining third shall revert to the House of Justice\u201d etc. In other words, where there are no offspring, their allotted portion of the inheritance reverteth to the House of Justice; and where there are offspring but the other categories of heirs are lacking, two-thirds of the inheritance pass to the offspring, the remaining third reverting to the House of Justice. This ruling hath both general and specific application, which is to say that whenever any category of this latter class of heirs is absent, two-thirds of their inheritance pass to the offspring and the remaining third to the House of Justice.\n\n\n8. \nQuestion: Concerning the basic sum on which \u1e24uq\u00faqu\u2019ll\u00e1h is payable.\nAnswer: The basic sum on which \u1e24uq\u00faqu\u2019ll\u00e1h is payable is nineteen mithq\u00e1ls of gold. In other words, when money to the value of this sum hath been acquired, a payment of \u1e24uq\u00faq falleth due. Likewise \u1e24uq\u00faq is payable when the value, not the number, of other forms of property reacheth the prescribed amount. \u1e24uq\u00faqu\u2019ll\u00e1h is payable no more than once. A person, for instance, who acquireth a thousand mithq\u00e1ls of gold, and payeth the \u1e24uq\u00faq, is not liable to make a further such payment on this sum, but only on what accrueth to it through commerce, business and the like. When this increase, namely the profit realized, reacheth the prescribed sum, one must carry out what God hath decreed. Only when the principal changeth hands is it once more subject to payment of \u1e24uq\u00faq, as it was the first time.

If the owner of the property is then found, it should be delivered up to him. Otherwise, the finder of the property should wait one year, and if, during this period, the owner cometh to light, the finder should receive from him the crier\u2019s fee and restore to him his property; only if the year should pass without the owner\u2019s being identified may the finder take possession of the property himself. If the value of the property is less than or equal to the crier\u2019s fee, the finder should wait a single day from the time of its discovery, at the end of which, if the owner hath not come to light, he may himself appropriate it; and in the case of property discovered in an uninhabited area, the finder should observe a three days\u2019 wait, on the passing of which period, if the identity of the owner remain unknown, he is free to take possession of his find.\n\n\n18. \nQuestion: With reference to the ablutions: if, for example, a person hath just bathed his entire body, must he still perform his ablutions? \nAnswer: The commandment regarding ablutions must, in any case, be observed.\n\n\n19. \nQuestion: Should a person plan to migrate from his country, and his wife be opposed and the disagreement culminate in divorce, and should his preparations for the journey extend until a year hath passed, may this period be counted as the year of patience, or should the day the couple part be regarded as the starting point of that year?\nAnswer: The starting point for computation is the day the couple part, and if, therefore, they have separated a year before the husband\u2019s departure, and if the fragrance of affection hath not been renewed between the couple, divorce may take place.

Consequently, as bidden, they were again read out in the Holy Presence, and brought into conformity with the grammatical conventions of the people in order to forestall the cavils of opponents of the Cause. Another reason for this practice is that the new style inaugurated by the Herald, may the souls of all else but Him be offered up for His sake, was seen to be marked by substantial latitude in adherence to the rules of grammar; sacred verses therefore were then revealed in a style which is for the most part in conformity with current usage for ease of understanding and concision of expression.\n\n\n58. \nQuestion: Concerning the blessed verse, \u201cWhen traveling, if ye should stop and rest in some safe spot, perform ye \u2026 a single prostration in place of each unsaid Obligatory Prayer\u201d: is this compensation for the Obligatory Prayer missed by reason of insecure circumstances, or is obligatory prayer completely suspended during travel, and doth the prostration take its place?\nAnswer: If, when the hour of obligatory prayer arriveth, there be no security, one should, upon arrival in safe surroundings, perform a prostration in place of each Obligatory Prayer that was missed, and after the final prostration, sit cross-legged and read the designated verse. If there be a safe place, obligatory prayer is not suspended during travel.\n\n\n59. \nQuestion: If, after a traveler hath stopped and rested it is the time for obligatory prayer, should he perform the prayer, or make the prostration in its stead?\nAnswer: Except in insecure circumstances omission of the Obligatory Prayer is not permissible.\n\n\n60. \nQuestion: If, due to missed Obligatory Prayers, a number of prostrations are required, must the verse be repeated after each compensating prostration or not? \nAnswer: It is sufficient to recite the designated verse after the last prostration.

Some years ago a number of the ordinances of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas including that Obligatory Prayer were, for reasons of wisdom, recorded separately and sent away together with other sacred writings, for the purposes of preservation and protection.

If a city dweller taketh up residence in a village, or a village dweller in a city, intending to settle permanently, what ruling is applicable?

Might it be explained how much of this nineteen should be paid?\nAnswer: Nineteen out of one hundred is established by the ordinance of God. Computation should be made on this basis. It may then be ascertained what amount is due on nineteen.\n\n\n90. \nQuestion: When one\u2019s wealth exceeds nineteen, is it necessary for it to increase by a further nineteen before \u1e24uq\u00faq is due again, or would it be due on any increase?\nAnswer: Any amount added to nineteen is exempt from \u1e24uq\u00faq until it reacheth a further nineteen.\n\n\n91. \nQuestion: Concerning pure water, and the point at which it is considered used.\nAnswer: Small quantities of water, such as one cupful, or even two or three, must be considered used after a single washing of the face and hands. But a kurr8 or more of water remaineth unchanged after one or two washings of the face, and there is no objection to its use unless it is altered in one of the three ways,9 for example its color is changed, in which case it should be looked upon as used.\n\n\n92. \nQuestion: In a treatise in Persian on various questions, the age of maturity hath been set at fifteen; is marriage likewise conditional upon the reaching of maturity, or is it permissible before that time?\nAnswer: Since the consent of both parties is required in the Book of God, and since, before maturity, their consent or lack of it cannot be ascertained, marriage is therefore conditional upon reaching the age of maturity, and is not permissible before that time.\n\n\n93. \nQuestion: Concerning fasting and obligatory prayer by the sick.\nAnswer: In truth, I say that obligatory prayer and fasting occupy an exalted station in the sight of God. It is, however, in a state of health that their virtue can be realized. In time of ill health it is not permissible to observe these obligations; such hath been the bidding of the Lord, exalted be His glory, at all times. Blessed be such men and women as pay heed, and observe His precepts.

The existing heirs should receive their allotted shares of the inheritance, while a statement of the remainder must be submitted to the Court of the Most High. In His hand is the source of authority; He ordaineth as He pleaseth. In this regard, a law was revealed in the Land of Mystery,10 temporarily awarding the missing heirs\u2019 inheritance to the existing heirs until such time as the House of Justice shall be established, when the decree concerning this will be promulgated. The inheritance, however, of those who emigrated in the same year as the Ancient Beauty, hath been awarded to their heirs, and this is a bounty of God bestowed upon them.\n\n\n101. \nQuestion: Concerning the law on treasure trove.\nAnswer: Should a treasure be found, one-third thereof is the right of the discoverer, and the other two-thirds should be expended by the men of the House of Justice for the welfare of all people.

In these climes, however, the difference in length is but a few hours, and therefore this ruling doth not apply.\n\n\n104. \nIn the Tablet to Ab\u00e1 Bad\u00ed\u2018, this holy verse hath been revealed: \u201cVerily, We have enjoined on every son to serve his father.\u201d Such is the decree which We have set forth in the Book.\n\n\n105. \nAnd in another Tablet, these exalted words have been revealed: O Mu\u1e25ammad! The Ancient of Days hath turned His countenance towards thee, making mention of thee, and exhorting the people of God to educate their children. Should a father neglect this most weighty commandment laid down in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas by the Pen of the Eternal King, he shall forfeit rights of fatherhood, and be accounted guilty before God. Well is it with him who imprinteth on his heart the admonitions of the Lord, and steadfastly cleaveth unto them. God, in truth, enjoineth on His servants what shall assist and profit them, and enable them to draw nigh unto Him. He is the Ordainer, the Everlasting. \n\n\n106. \nHe is God, exalted be He, the Lord of majesty and power! The Prophets and Chosen Ones have all been commissioned by the One True God, magnified be His glory, to nurture the trees of human existence with the living waters of uprightness and understanding, that there may appear from them that which God hath deposited within their inmost selves. As may be readily observed, each tree yieldeth a certain fruit, and a barren tree is but fit for fire. The purpose of these Educators, in all they said and taught, was to preserve man\u2019s exalted station. Well is it with him who in the Day of God hath laid fast hold upon His precepts and hath not deviated from His true and fundamental Law. The fruits that best befit the tree of human life are trustworthiness and godliness, truthfulness and sincerity; but greater than all, after recognition of the unity of God, praised and glorified be He, is regard for the rights that are due to one\u2019s parents. This teaching hath been mentioned in all the Books of God, and reaffirmed by the Most Exalted Pen. Consider that which the Merciful Lord hath revealed in the Qur\u2019\u00e1n, exalted are His words: \u201cWorship ye God, join with Him no peer or likeness; and show forth kindliness and charity towards your parents\u2026\u201d Observe how loving-kindness to one\u2019s parents hath been linked to recognition of the one true God! Happy they who are endued with true wisdom and understanding, who see and perceive, who read and understand, and who observe that which God hath revealed in the Holy Books of old, and in this incomparable and wondrous Tablet.\n\n\n107. \nIn one of the Tablets He, exalted be His words, hath revealed: And in the matter of Zak\u00e1t, We have likewise decreed that you should follow what hath been revealed in the Qur\u2019\u00e1n.\n\n\n\nSynopsis and Codification of the Laws and Ordinances of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas\n\n\n\n\nSummary of Contents\n1.

A further period of waiting after divorce has taken place is not required.\n         4. The wife who is to be divorced as a result of her unfaithfulness forfeits the payment of the expenses during the waiting period.\n         5. Remarrying the wife whom one has divorced is permissible, provided she has not married another person. If she has, she must be divorced before her former husband can remarry her.\n         6.

If this reconciliation is followed by estrangement and divorce is again desired, a new year of waiting will have to be commenced.\n         7. Should differences arise between husband and wife while traveling, he is required to send her home, or entrust her to a dependable person, who will escort her there, paying her journey and her full year\u2019s expenses.\n         8.

In cases where there is no issue the share of the children reverts to the House of Justice to be expended on orphans and widows and for whatever will profit mankind.\n            2. If the son of the deceased be dead and leave issue, these will inherit the share of their father. If the daughter of the deceased be dead and leave issue, her share will have to be divided into the seven categories specified in the Most Holy Book.\n         4. Should one leave offspring but either part or all of the other categories of inheritors be nonexistent, two-thirds of their shares reverts to the offspring and one-third to the House of Justice.\n         5. Should none of the specified beneficiaries exist, two-thirds of the inheritance reverts to the nephews and nieces of the deceased. If these do not exist, the same share reverts to the aunts and uncles; lacking these, to their sons and daughters. In any case the remaining third reverts to the House of Justice.\n         6. Should one leave none of the aforementioned heirs, the entire inheritance reverts to the House of Justice.\n         7. The residence and the personal clothing of the deceased father pass to the male not to the female offspring. If there be several residences the principal and most important one passes to the male offspring. The remaining residences will together with the other possessions of the deceased have to be divided among the heirs. If there be no male offspring two-thirds of the principal residence and the personal clothing of the deceased father will revert to the female issue and one-third to the House of Justice. In the case of the deceased mother all her used clothing is to be equally divided amongst her daughters. Her unworn clothing, jewels and property must be divided among her heirs, as well as her used clothing if she leaves no daughter.\n         8. Should the children of the deceased be minors their share should either be entrusted to a reliable person or to a company for purposes of investment, until they attain the age of maturity. A share of the interest accrued should be assigned to the trustee.\n         9. The inheritance should not be divided until after the payment of the \u1e24uq\u00faqu\u2019ll\u00e1h (The Right of God), of any debts contracted by the deceased and of any expenses incurred for a befitting funeral and burial.\n         10. If the brother of the deceased is from the same father he will inherit his full allotted share. If he is from another father he will inherit only two-thirds of his share, the remaining one-third reverting to the House of Justice. The same law is applicable to the sister of the deceased.\n         11. In case there are full brothers or full sisters, brothers and sisters from the mother\u2019s side do not inherit.\n         12. A non-Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed teacher does not inherit. If there should be more than one teacher, the share allotted to the teacher is to be equally divided among them.\n         13. Non-Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed heirs do not inherit.\n         14. Aside from the wife\u2019s used clothing and gifts of jewelry or otherwise which have been proven to have been given her by her husband, whatever the husband has purchased for his wife are to be considered as the husband\u2019s possessions to be divided among his heirs.\n         15.

The metaphor of the fragrant \u201cgarment\u201d is frequently used in the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Writings to refer to the recognition of the Manifestation of God and His Revelation.\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, in one of His Tablets, describes Himself as the \u201cDivine Joseph\u201d Who has been \u201cbartered away\u201d by the heedless \u201cfor the most paltry of prices.\u201d The B\u00e1b, in the Qayy\u00famu\u2019l-Asm\u00e1\u2019, identifies Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h as the \u201ctrue Joseph\u201d and forecasts the ordeals that He would endure at the hands of His treacherous brother (see note 190). Likewise, Shoghi Effendi draws a parallel between the intense jealousy which the preeminence of \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 had aroused in His half-brother, M\u00edrz\u00e1 Mu\u1e25ammad-\u2018Al\u00ed, and the deadly envy \u201cwhich the superior excellence of Joseph had kindled in the hearts of his brothers.\u201d\n\n\n2. We have unsealed the choice Wine with the fingers of might and power. \u00b65\nThe consumption of wine and other intoxicants is prohibited in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas (see notes 144 and 170).\nReference to the use of \u201cwine\u201d in an allegorical sense\u2014such as being the cause of spiritual ecstasy\u2014is found, not only in the Revelation of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, but in the Bible, in the Qur\u2019\u00e1n, and in ancient Hindu traditions.\nFor example, in the Qur\u2019\u00e1n the righteous are promised that they will be given to drink of the \u201cchoice sealed wine.\u201d In His Tablets, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h identifies the \u201cchoice Wine\u201d with His Revelation whose \u201cmusk-laden fragrance\u201d has been wafted \u201cupon all created things.\u201d He states that He has \u201cunsealed\u201d this \u201cWine,\u201d thereby disclosing spiritual truths that were hitherto unknown, and enabling those who quaff thereof to \u201cdiscern the splendors of the light of divine unity\u201d and to \u201cgrasp the essential purpose underlying the Scriptures of God.\u201d\nIn one of His meditations, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h entreats God to supply the believers with \u201cthe choice Wine of Thy mercy, that it may cause them to be forgetful of anyone except Thee, and to arise to serve Thy Cause, and to be steadfast in their love for Thee.\u201d", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7fd4f62-8d2e-4f7d-8e25-e1c0d87c2cb8": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7fd4f62-8d2e-4f7d-8e25-e1c0d87c2cb8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "844abeca-a0e8-42a4-8b2d-6caf622a8ac8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "6bd77545825f4671b13ada538536357190c05de02870b9193d626817f4761659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3867f56-b1bb-4b39-b508-d10a3dd2a582", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "cd5166deaddc4c58409626dca988d00fe6ab117812f2013757b384eca816c9d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "33e6986c-0b34-4638-a2d7-a81953aef360", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "89eb5468fdc465b22df9e12b170a86b25c0928c8fc077c7145aba37d209ea0ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "0fec2f6f6a26d40a752ad88eefa3268c78ab13305c3bc66fc853b93a0c44869d", "text": "3. We have enjoined obligatory prayer upon you \u00b66\nIn Arabic, there are several words for prayer. The word \u201c\u1e63al\u00e1t,\u201d which appears here in the original, refers to a particular category of prayers, the recitation of which at specific times of the day is enjoined on the believers. To differentiate this category of prayers from other kinds, the word has been translated as \u201cobligatory prayer.\u201d\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h states that \u201cobligatory prayer and fasting occupy an exalted station in the sight of God\u201d (Q&A 93). \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 affirms that such prayers are \u201cconducive to humility and submissiveness, to setting one\u2019s face towards God and expressing devotion to Him,\u201d and that through these prayers \u201cman holdeth communion with God, seeketh to draw near unto Him, converseth with the true Beloved of his heart, and attaineth spiritual stations.\u201d\nThe Obligatory Prayer (see note 9) referred to in this verse has been superseded by the three Obligatory Prayers later revealed by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h (Q&A 63). The texts of the three prayers currently in use, together with instructions regarding their recital, are to be found in this volume in Some Texts Supplementary to the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas.\nA number of the items in Questions and Answers deal with aspects of the three new Obligatory Prayers. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h clarifies that the individual is permitted to choose any one of the three Obligatory Prayers (Q&A 65). Other provisions are elucidated in Questions and Answers, numbers 66, 67, 81, and 82.\nThe details of the law concerning obligatory prayer are summarized in section IV.A.1.\u201317. of the Synopsis and Codification.\n\n\n4. nine rak\u2018ahs \u00b66\nA rak\u2018ah is the recitation of specifically revealed verses accompanied by a prescribed set of genuflections and other movements.\nThe Obligatory Prayer originally enjoined by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h upon His followers consisted of nine rak\u2018ahs. The precise nature of this prayer and the specific instructions for its recitation are unknown, as the prayer has been lost. (See note 9.)\nIn a Tablet commenting on the presently binding Obligatory Prayers, \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 indicates that \u201cin every word and movement of the Obligatory Prayer there are allusions, mysteries and a wisdom that man is unable to comprehend, and letters and scrolls cannot contain.\u201d\nShoghi Effendi explains that the few simple directions given by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h for the recital of certain prayers not only have a spiritual significance but that they also help the individual \u201cto fully concentrate when praying and meditating.\u201d\n\n\n5. at noon and in the morning and the evening \u00b66\nRegarding the definition of the words \u201cmorning,\u201d \u201cnoon\u201d and \u201cevening,\u201d at which times the currently binding medium Obligatory Prayer is to be recited, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h has stated that these coincide with \u201csunrise, noon and sunset\u201d (Q&A 83). He specifies that the \u201callowable times for Obligatory Prayers are from morning till noon, from noon till sunset, and from sunset till two hours thereafter.\u201d Further, \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 has stated that the morning Obligatory Prayer may be said as early as dawn.\nThe definition of \u201cnoon\u201d as the period \u201cfrom noon till sunset\u201d applies to the recitation of the short Obligatory Prayer as well as the medium one.\n\n\n6. We have relieved you of a greater number \u00b66\nThe requirements for obligatory prayer called for in the B\u00e1b\u00ed and Islamic Dispensations were more demanding than those for the performance of the Obligatory Prayer consisting of nine rak\u2018ahs that was prescribed in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas (see note 4).\nIn the Bay\u00e1n, the B\u00e1b prescribed an Obligatory Prayer consisting of nineteen rak\u2018ahs which was to be performed once in a twenty-four-hour period\u2014from noon of one day to noon of the next.\nThe Muslim prayer is recited five times a day, namely, in the early morning, at midday, in the afternoon and evening, and at night.

When ye desire to perform this prayer, turn ye towards the Court of My Most Holy Presence, this Hallowed Spot that God hath \u2026 decreed to be the Point of Adoration for the denizens of the Cities of Eternity \u00b66\nThe \u201cPoint of Adoration,\u201d that is, the point to which the worshiper should turn when offering obligatory prayer, is called the Qiblih. The concept of Qiblih has existed in previous religions. Jerusalem in the past had been fixed for this purpose. Mu\u1e25ammad changed the Qiblih to Mecca. The B\u00e1b\u2019s instructions in the Arabic Bay\u00e1n were:\n\n\nThe Qiblih is indeed He Whom God will make manifest; whenever He moveth, it moveth, until He shall come to rest.\n\n\nThis passage is quoted by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas (\u00b6137) and confirmed by Him in the above-noted verse. He has also indicated that facing in the direction of the Qiblih is a \u201cfixed requirement for the recitation of obligatory prayer\u201d (Q&A 14 and 67). However, for other prayers and devotions the individual may face in any direction.\n\n\n8. and when the Sun of Truth and Utterance shall set, turn your faces towards the Spot that We have ordained for you \u00b66\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h ordains His resting-place as the Qiblih after His passing. The Most Holy Tomb is at Bahj\u00ed, \u2018Akk\u00e1. \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 describes that Spot as the \u201cluminous Shrine,\u201d \u201cthe place around which circumambulate the Concourse on high.\u201d\nIn a letter written on his behalf, Shoghi Effendi uses the analogy of the plant turning in the direction of the sun to explain the spiritual significance of turning towards the Qiblih:\n\n\n\u2026 just as the plant stretches out to the sunlight\u2014from which it receives life and growth\u2014so we turn our hearts to the Manifestation of God, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, when we pray; \u2026 we turn our faces \u2026 to where His dust lies on this earth as a symbol of the inner act.\n\n\n9. We have set forth the details of obligatory prayer in another Tablet. \u00b68\nThe original Obligatory Prayer had \u201cfor reasons of wisdom\u201d been revealed by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h in a separate Tablet (Q&A 63). It was not released to the believers in His lifetime, having been superseded by the three Obligatory Prayers now in use.\nShortly after the Ascension of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, the text of this prayer, along with a number of other Tablets, was stolen by Mu\u1e25ammad-\u2018Al\u00ed, the Arch-breaker of His Covenant.\n\n\n10. the Prayer for the Dead \u00b68\nThe Prayer for the Dead (see Some Texts Supplementary to the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas) is the only Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed obligatory prayer which is to be recited in congregation; it is to be recited by one believer while all present stand in silence (see note 19). Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h has clarified that the Prayer for the Dead is required only when the deceased is an adult (Q&A 70), that the recital should precede the interment of the deceased, and that there is no requirement to face the Qiblih when saying this prayer (Q&A 85).\nFurther details concerning the Prayer for the Dead are summarized in the Synopsis and Codification, section IV.A. 13.\u201314.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36bd79b9-2ff3-4688-ab8e-4a89212daa4f": {"__data__": {"id_": "36bd79b9-2ff3-4688-ab8e-4a89212daa4f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "844abeca-a0e8-42a4-8b2d-6caf622a8ac8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "6bd77545825f4671b13ada538536357190c05de02870b9193d626817f4761659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "33e6986c-0b34-4638-a2d7-a81953aef360", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "89eb5468fdc465b22df9e12b170a86b25c0928c8fc077c7145aba37d209ea0ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "465f6cb9-7823-4960-ad4b-680131352d7e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "bd701c464e709a9f50ec4936c09a1065e4e3696f764f0cd368974a57e22fb915", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9428884ab59e1653fd0f45c5be3c5d7fce3f1182400d992e5269ed7dba5d11ae", "text": "10. the Prayer for the Dead \u00b68\nThe Prayer for the Dead (see Some Texts Supplementary to the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas) is the only Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed obligatory prayer which is to be recited in congregation; it is to be recited by one believer while all present stand in silence (see note 19).

These verses are identical with those in the Prayer for the Dead revealed by the B\u00e1b in the Bay\u00e1n. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h added a supplication to precede these passages.\n\n\n12. Hair doth not invalidate your prayer, nor aught from which the spirit hath departed, such as bones and the like. Ye are free to wear the fur of the sable as ye would that of the beaver, the squirrel, and other animals \u00b69\nIn some earlier religious Dispensations, the wearing of the hair of certain animals or having certain other objects on one\u2019s person was held to invalidate one\u2019s prayer. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h here confirms the B\u00e1b\u2019s pronouncement in the Arabic Bay\u00e1n that such things do not invalidate one\u2019s prayer.\n\n\n13. We have commanded you to pray and fast from the beginning of maturity \u00b610\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h defines the \u201cage of maturity with respect to religious duties\u201d as \u201cfifteen for both men and women\u201d (Q&A 20). For details of the period of fasting, see note 25. \n\n\n14. He hath exempted from this those who are weak from illness or age \u00b610\nThe exemption of those who are weak due to illness or advanced age from offering the Obligatory Prayers and from fasting is explained in Questions and Answers. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h indicates that in \u201ctime of ill health it is not permissible to observe these obligations\u201d (Q&A 93). He defines old age, in this context, as being from seventy (Q&A 74). In answer to a question, Shoghi Effendi has clarified that people who attain the age of seventy are exempt, whether or not they are weak.\nExemption from fasting is also granted to the other specific categories of people listed in the Synopsis and Codification, section IV.B.5. See notes 20, 30 and 31 for additional discussion.\n\n\n15. God hath granted you leave to prostrate yourselves on any surface that is clean, for We have removed in this regard the limitation that had been laid down in the Book \u00b610\nThe requirements of prayer in previous Dispensations have often included prostration. In the Arabic Bay\u00e1n the B\u00e1b called upon the believers to lay their foreheads on surfaces of crystal when prostrating. Similarly, in Isl\u00e1m, certain restrictions are imposed with regard to the surface on which Muslims are permitted to prostrate. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h abrogates such restrictions and simply specifies \u201cany surface that is clean.\u201d\n\n\n16. Let him that findeth no water for ablution repeat five times the words \u201cIn the Name of God, the Most Pure, the Most Pure,\u201d and then proceed to his devotions. \u00b610\nAblutions are to be performed by the believer in preparation for the offering of obligatory prayer. They consist of washing the hands and face. If water is unavailable, the repetition five times of the specifically revealed verse is prescribed. See note 34 for a general discussion of ablutions.\nAntecedents in earlier Dispensations for the provision of substitute procedures to be followed when no water is available are found in the Qur\u2019\u00e1n and in the Arabic Bay\u00e1n.\n\n\n17. In regions where the days and nights grow long, let times of prayer be gauged by clocks and other instruments that mark the passage of the hours. \u00b610\nThis refers to territories situated in the extreme north or south, where the duration of days and nights varies markedly (Q&A 64 and 103).

This provision applies also to fasting.\n\n\n18. We have absolved you from the requirement of performing the Prayer of the Signs. \u00b611\nThe Prayer of the Signs is a special form of Muslim obligatory prayer that was ordained to be said in times of natural events, like earthquakes, eclipses, and other such phenomena, which may cause fear and are taken to be signs or acts of God. The requirement of performing this prayer has been annulled. In its place a Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed may say, \u201cDominion is God\u2019s, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, the Lord of creation,\u201d but this is not obligatory (Q&A 52).\n\n\n19. Save in the Prayer for the Dead, the practice of congregational prayer hath been annulled. \u00b612\nCongregational prayer, in the sense of formal obligatory prayer which is to be recited in accordance with a prescribed ritual as, for example, is the custom in Isl\u00e1m where Friday prayer in the mosque is led by an im\u00e1m, has been annulled in the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Dispensation. The Prayer for the Dead (see note 10) is the only congregational prayer prescribed by Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed law. It is to be recited by one of those present while the remainder of the party stands in silence; the reader has no special status. The congregation is not required to face the Qiblih (Q&A 85).\nThe three daily Obligatory Prayers are to be recited individually, not in congregation.\nThere is no prescribed way for the recital of the many other Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed prayers, and all are free to use such non-obligatory prayers in gatherings or individually as they please. In this regard, Shoghi Effendi states that\n\n\n\u2026although the friends are thus left free to follow their own inclination \u2026 they should take the utmost care that any manner they practice should not acquire too rigid a character, and thus develop into an institution. This is a point which the friends should always bear in mind, lest they deviate from the clear path indicated by the Teachings.\n\n\n20. God hath exempted women who are in their courses from obligatory prayer and fasting. \u00b613\nExemption from obligatory prayer and fasting is granted to women who are menstruating; they should, instead, perform their ablutions (see note 34) and repeat 95 times a day between one noon and the next, the verse \u201cGlorified be God, the Lord of Splendor and Beauty.\u201d This provision has its antecedent in the Arabic Bay\u00e1n, where a similar dispensation was granted.\nIn some earlier religious Dispensations, women in their courses were considered ritually unclean and were forbidden to observe the duties of prayer and fasting. The concept of ritual uncleanness has been abolished by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h (see note 106).\nThe Universal House of Justice has clarified that the provisions in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas granting exemptions from certain duties and responsibilities are, as the word indicates, exemptions and not prohibitions. Any believer is, therefore, free to avail himself or herself of an applicable exemption if he or she so wishes. However, the House of Justice counsels that, in deciding whether to do so or not, the believer should use wisdom and realize that Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h has granted these exemptions for good reason.\nThe prescribed exemption from obligatory prayer, originally related to the Obligatory Prayer consisting of nine rak\u2018ahs, is now applicable to the three Obligatory Prayers which superseded it.\n\n\n21. When traveling, if ye should stop and rest in some safe spot, perform ye\u2014men and women alike\u2014a single prostration in place of each unsaid Obligatory Prayer \u00b614\nExemption from obligatory prayer is granted to those who find themselves in such a condition of insecurity that the saying of the Obligatory Prayers is not possible. The exemption applies whether one is traveling or at home, and it provides a means whereby Obligatory Prayers which have remained unsaid on account of these insecure circumstances may be compensated for.\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h has made it clear that obligatory prayer \u201cis not suspended during travel\u201d so long as one can find a \u201csafe spot\u201d in which to perform it (Q&A 58).\nNumbers 21, 58, 59, 60, and 61 in Questions and Answers amplify this provision.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b40cbbf-8e07-45e3-9136-d553f13af57a": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b40cbbf-8e07-45e3-9136-d553f13af57a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "844abeca-a0e8-42a4-8b2d-6caf622a8ac8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "6bd77545825f4671b13ada538536357190c05de02870b9193d626817f4761659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "465f6cb9-7823-4960-ad4b-680131352d7e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "bd701c464e709a9f50ec4936c09a1065e4e3696f764f0cd368974a57e22fb915", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0bb85518-bcaa-44f8-81f9-ac8b7e7ec289", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "dd48981eb827514fbcb196d74cfbb4615e37fe5df3865bba2f51974011c02701", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "627bc5d5784acea16cc84d3c7239fe63da02139396844936d1fb262c54f5e850", "text": "21.

Upon completing your prostrations, seat yourselves cross-legged \u00b614\nThe Arabic expression \u201chaykalu\u2019t-taw\u1e25\u00edd,\u201d translated here as \u201ccross-legged,\u201d means the \u201cposture of unity.\u201d It has traditionally signified a cross-legged position.\n\n\n23. Say: God hath made My hidden love the key to the Treasure \u00b615\nThere is a well-known Islamic tradition concerning God and His creation: \n\n\nI was a Hidden Treasure. I wished to be made known, and thus I called creation into being in order that I might be known.\n\n\nReferences and allusions to this tradition are found throughout the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Writings. For example, in one of His prayers, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h reveals:\n\n\nLauded be Thy name, O Lord my God! I testify that Thou wast a hidden Treasure wrapped within Thine immemorial Being and an impenetrable Mystery enshrined in Thine own Essence. Wishing to reveal Thyself, Thou didst call into being the Greater and the Lesser Worlds, and didst choose Man above all Thy creatures, and didst make Him a sign of both of these worlds, O Thou Who art our Lord, the Most Compassionate!\nThou didst raise Him up to occupy Thy throne before all the people of Thy creation. Thou didst enable Him to unravel Thy mysteries, and to shine with the lights of Thine inspiration and Thy Revelation, and to manifest Thy names and Thine attributes. Through Him Thou didst adorn the preamble of the book of Thy creation, O Thou Who art the Ruler of the universe Thou hast fashioned! (Prayers and Meditations by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, XXXVIII)\n\n\nLikewise, in the Hidden Words, He states:\n\n\nO Son of Man! I loved thy creation, hence I created thee. Wherefore, do thou love Me, that I may name thy name and fill thy soul with the Spirit of life.\n\n\n\u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1, in His commentary on the above-cited tradition, wrote:\n\n\nO wayfarer in the path of the Beloved! Know thou that the main purpose of this holy tradition is to make mention of the stages of God\u2019s concealment and manifestation within the Embodiments of Truth, They who are the Dawning-places of His All-Glorious Being. For example, before the flame of the undying fire is lit and manifest, it existeth by itself within itself in the hidden identity of the universal Manifestations, and this is the stage of the \u201cHidden Treasure.\u201d And when the blessed Tree is kindled by itself within itself, and that Divine fire burneth by its essence within its essence, this is the stage of \u201cI wished to be made known.\u201d And when it shineth forth from the Horizon of the universe with infinite Divine Names and Attributes upon the contingent and placeless worlds, this constituteth the emergence of a new and wondrous creation which correspondeth to the stage of \u201cThus I called creation into being.\u201d And when the sanctified souls rend asunder the veils of all earthly attachments and worldly conditions, and hasten to the stage of gazing on the beauty of the Divine Presence and are honored by recognizing the Manifestation and are able to witness the splendor of God\u2019s Most Great Sign in their hearts, then will the purpose of creation, which is the knowledge of Him Who is the Eternal Truth, become manifest.\n\n\n\n\n24.

We have enjoined upon you fasting during a brief period \u00b616\nFasting and obligatory prayer constitute the two pillars that sustain the revealed Law of God. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h in one of His Tablets affirms that He has revealed the laws of obligatory prayer and fasting so that through them the believers may draw nigh unto God.\nShoghi Effendi indicates that the fasting period, which involves complete abstention from food and drink from sunrise till sunset, is\n\n\n\u2026essentially a period of meditation and prayer, of spiritual recuperation, during which the believer must strive to make the necessary readjustments in his inner life, and to refresh and reinvigorate the spiritual forces latent in his soul. Its significance and purpose are, therefore, fundamentally spiritual in character. Fasting is symbolic, and a reminder of abstinence from selfish and carnal desires.\n\n\nFasting is enjoined on all the believers once they attain the age of 15 and until they reach the age of 70 years.\nA summary of the detailed provisions concerning the law of fasting and of the exemptions granted to certain categories of people is contained in the Synopsis and Codification, section IV.B.1.\u20136. For a discussion of the exemptions from fasting see notes 14, 20, 30 and 31.\nThe nineteen-day period of fasting coincides with the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed month of \u2018Al\u00e1\u2019, usually 2\u201320 March, immediately after the termination of the Intercalary Days (see notes 27 and 147), and is followed by the feast of Naw-R\u00faz (see note 26).1\n\n\n26. and at its close have designated for you Naw-R\u00faz as a feast \u00b616\nThe B\u00e1b introduced a new calendar, known now as the Bad\u00ed\u2018 or Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed calendar (see notes 27 and 147). According to this calendar, a day is the period from sunset to sunset. In the Bay\u00e1n, the B\u00e1b ordained the month of \u2018Al\u00e1\u2019 to be the month of fasting, decreed that the day of Naw-R\u00faz should mark the termination of that period, and designated Naw-R\u00faz as the Day of God. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h confirms the Bad\u00ed\u2018 calendar wherein Naw-R\u00faz is designated as a feast.\nNaw-R\u00faz is the first day of the new year. It coincides with the spring equinox in the Northern Hemisphere, which usually occurs on 21 March. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h explains that this feast day is to be celebrated on whatever day the sun passes into the constellation of Aries (i.e. the vernal equinox), even should this occur one minute before sunset (Q&A 35). Hence Naw-R\u00faz could fall on 20, 21, or 22 March, depending on the time of the equinox.\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h has left the details of many laws to be filled in by the Universal House of Justice. Among these are a number of matters affecting the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed calendar. The Guardian has stated that the implementation, worldwide, of the law concerning the timing of Naw-R\u00faz will require the choice of a particular spot on earth which will serve as the standard for the fixing of the time of the spring equinox. He also indicated that the choice of this spot has been left to the decision of the Universal House of Justice.2\n\n\n27. Let the days in excess of the months be placed before the month of fasting. \u00b616\nThe Bad\u00ed\u2018 calendar is based on the solar year of 365 days, 5 hours, and 50 odd minutes. The year consists of 19 months of 19 days each (i.e. 361 days), with the addition of four extra days (five in a leap year). The B\u00e1b did not specifically define the place for the intercalary days in the new calendar. The Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas resolves this question by assigning the \u201cexcess\u201d days a fixed position in the calendar immediately preceding the month of \u2018Al\u00e1\u2019, the period of fasting.

We have ordained that these \u2026 shall be the manifestations of the letter H\u00e1 \u00b616\nKnown as the Ayy\u00e1m-i-H\u00e1 (the Days of H\u00e1), the Intercalary Days have the distinction of being associated with \u201cthe letter H\u00e1.\u201d The abjad numerical value of this Arabic letter is five, which corresponds to the potential number of intercalary days.\nThe letter \u201cH\u00e1\u201d has been given several spiritual meanings in the Holy Writings, among which is as a symbol of the Essence of God.\n\n\n29. these days of giving that precede the season of restraint. \u00b616\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h enjoined upon His followers to devote these days to feasting, rejoicing and charity. In a letter written on Shoghi Effendi\u2019s behalf it is explained that \u201cthe intercalary days are specially set aside for hospitality, the giving of gifts, etc.\u201d\n\n\n30. The traveler \u2026 not bound by the Fast \u00b616\nThe minimum duration of a journey which exempts the believer from fasting is defined by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h (Q&A 22 and 75). The details of this provision are summarized in the Synopsis and Codification, section IV.B.5.a.i.\u2013v.\nShoghi Effendi has clarified that while travelers are exempt from fasting, they are free to fast if they so wish. He also indicated that the exemption applies during the whole period of one\u2019s travel, not just the hours one is in a train or car, etc.\n\n\n31. The traveler, the ailing, those who are with child or giving suck, are not bound by the Fast; they have been exempted by God as a token of His grace. \u00b616\nExemption from fasting is granted to those who are ill or of advanced age (see note 14), women in their courses (see note 20), travelers (see note 30) and to women who are pregnant and those who are nursing. This exemption is also extended to people who are engaged in heavy labor, who, at the same time, are advised \u201cto show respect to the law of God and for the exalted station of the Fast\u201d by eating \u201cwith frugality and in private\u201d (Q&A 76). Shoghi Effendi has indicated that the types of work which would exempt people from the Fast will be defined by the Universal House of Justice.\n\n\n32. Abstain from food and drink from sunrise to sundown \u00b617\nThis relates to the period of fasting. In one of His Tablets, \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1, after stating that fasting consists of abstinence from food and drink, further indicates that smoking is a form of \u201cdrink.\u201d In Arabic the verb \u201cdrink\u201d applies equally to smoking.\n\n\n33. It hath been ordained that every believer in God \u2026 shall, each day \u2026 repeat \u201cAll\u00e1h-u-Abh\u00e1\u201d ninety-five times. \u00b618\n\u201cAll\u00e1h-u-Abh\u00e1\u201d is an Arabic phrase meaning \u201cGod the All-Glorious.\u201d It is a form of the Greatest Name of God (see note 137). In Isl\u00e1m there is a tradition that among the many names of God, one was the greatest; however, the identity of this Greatest Name was hidden. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h has confirmed that the Greatest Name is \u201cBah\u00e1.\u201d\nThe various derivatives of the word \u201cBah\u00e1\u201d are also regarded as the Greatest Name. Shoghi Effendi\u2019s secretary writing on his behalf explains that\n\n\nThe Greatest Name is the Name of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h. \u201cY\u00e1 Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019l-Abh\u00e1\u201d is an invocation meaning: \u201cO Thou Glory of Glories!\u201d \u201cAll\u00e1h-u-Abh\u00e1\u201d is a greeting which means: \u201cGod the All-Glorious.\u201d Both refer to Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h.

Perform ye \u2026 ablutions for the Obligatory Prayer \u00b618\nAblutions are specifically associated with certain prayers. They must precede the offering of the three Obligatory Prayers, the daily recitation of \u201cAll\u00e1h-u-Abh\u00e1\u201d ninety-five times, and the recital of the verse prescribed as an alternative to obligatory prayer and fasting for women in their courses (see note 20).\nThe prescribed ablutions consist of washing the hands and the face in preparation for prayer. In the case of the medium Obligatory Prayer, this is accompanied by the recitation of certain verses (see Some Texts Revealed by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h Supplementary to the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas).\nThat ablutions have a significance beyond washing may be seen from the fact that even should one have bathed oneself immediately before reciting the Obligatory Prayer, it would still be necessary to perform ablutions (Q&A 18).\nWhen no water is available for ablutions, a prescribed verse is to be repeated five times (see note 16), and this provision is extended to those for whom the use of water would be physically harmful (Q&A 51).\nThe detailed provisions of the law concerning ablutions are set out in the Synopsis and Codification, section IV.A.10.a.\u2013g., as well as in Questions and Answers numbers 51, 62, 66, 77 and 86.\n\n\n35. Ye have been forbidden to commit murder \u00b619\nThe prohibition against taking another\u2019s life is repeated by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h in paragraph 73 of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas. Penalties are prescribed for premeditated murder (see note 86). In the case of manslaughter, it is necessary to pay a specified indemnity to the family of the deceased (see Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas, \u00b6188).\n\n\n36. or adultery \u00b619\nThe Arabic word \u201czin\u00e1,\u201d here translated as \u201cadultery,\u201d signifies both fornication and adultery. It applies not only to sexual relations between a married person and someone who is not his or her spouse, but also to extramarital sexual intercourse in general. One form of \u201czin\u00e1\u201d is rape. The only penalty prescribed by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h is for those who commit fornication (see note 77); penalties for other kinds of sexual offense are left to the Universal House of Justice to determine.\n\n\n37. backbiting or calumny \u00b619\nBackbiting, slander and dwelling on the faults of others have been repeatedly condemned by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h. In the Hidden Words, He clearly states: \u201cO Son of Being! How couldst thou forget thine own faults and busy thyself with the faults of others? Whoso doeth this is accursed of Me.\u201d And again: \u201cO Son of Man! Breathe not the sins of others so long as thou art thyself a sinner. Shouldst thou transgress this command, accursed wouldst thou be, and to this I bear witness.\u201d This strong admonition is further reiterated in His last work, \u201cthe Book of My Covenant\u201d: \u201cVerily I say, the tongue is for mentioning what is good, defile it not with unseemly talk. God hath forgiven what is past. Henceforward everyone should utter that which is meet and seemly, and should refrain from slander, abuse and whatever causeth sadness in men.\u201d", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24a82fef-6893-47d1-8029-f5e539aa63f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "24a82fef-6893-47d1-8029-f5e539aa63f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "844abeca-a0e8-42a4-8b2d-6caf622a8ac8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "6bd77545825f4671b13ada538536357190c05de02870b9193d626817f4761659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "98e31969-2f4a-4017-8807-cfde96518d17", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "7f2c9804a35d1dd8bd72b1acb84abe9dade03fcffa23f47302c8ba553b93ff56", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "90ddb31c-bb17-4a4d-b544-fe02db1e8c83", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "31f4b32e0899dcb56df760e7a88b87302016e245c04d01129a268203be4cb01e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1aaab7e4ffc2fcfbd085bd0a6ee50c5d6e740f902facc54c801003376fc97f65", "text": "38. We have divided inheritance into seven categories \u00b620\nThe Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed laws of inheritance apply only in case of intestacy, that is, when the individual dies without leaving a will. In the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas (\u00b6109), Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h instructs every believer to write a will. He elsewhere clearly states that the individual has full jurisdiction over his property and is free to determine the manner in which his or her estate is to be divided and to designate, in the will, those, whether Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed or non-Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed, who should inherit (Q&A 69). In this connection, a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi explains that:\n\n\n\u2026even though a Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed is permitted in his will to dispose of his wealth in the way he wishes, yet he is morally and conscientiously bound to always bear in mind, while writing his will, the necessity of his upholding the principle of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h regarding the social function of wealth, and the consequent necessity of avoiding its overaccumulation and concentration in a few individuals or groups of individuals.\n\n\nThis verse of the Aqdas introduces a lengthy passage in which Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h elaborates the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed law of inheritance. In reading this passage one should bear in mind that the law is formulated with the presumption that the deceased is a man; its provisions apply, mutatis mutandis, when the deceased is a woman.\nThe system of inheritance which provides for distribution of the deceased\u2019s estate among seven categories of heirs (children, spouse, father, mother, brothers, sisters, and teachers) is based on the provisions set out by the B\u00e1b in the Bay\u00e1n. The major features of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed laws of inheritance in the case of intestacy are:\n   1. If the deceased is a father and his estate includes a personal residence, such residence passes to the eldest son (Q&A 34).\n   2. If the deceased has no male descendants, two-thirds of the residence pass to his female descendants and the remaining third passes to the House of Justice (Q&A 41, 72). See note 42 concerning the levels of the institution of the House of Justice to which this law applies. (See also note 44.)\n   3. The remainder of the estate is divided among the seven categories of heirs. For details of the number of shares to be received by each group, see Questions and Answers, number 5, and Synopsis and Codification, section IV.C.3.a.\n   4. In case there is more than one heir in any category the share allotted to that class should be divided between them equally, be they male or female.\n   5. In cases where there is no issue, the share of the children reverts to the House of Justice (Q&A 7, 41).\n   6. Should one leave offspring, but either part or all of the other categories of heirs be nonexistent, two-thirds of their shares revert to the offspring and one-third to the House of Justice (Q&A 7).\n   7. Should none of the specified categories exist, two-thirds of the estate revert to the nephews and nieces of the deceased. If these do not exist, the same shares revert to the aunts and uncles; lacking these, to their sons and daughters. In any case the remaining third reverts to the House of Justice.\n   8. Should one leave none of the aforementioned heirs, the entire estate reverts to the House of Justice.\n   9. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h states that non-Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds have no right to inherit from their Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed parents or relatives (Q&A 34). Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on his behalf indicates that this restriction applies \u201conly to such cases when a Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed dies without leaving a will and when, therefore, his property will have to be divided in accordance with the rules set forth in the Aqdas. Otherwise, a Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed is free to bequeath his property to any person, irrespective of religion, provided however he leaves a will, specifying his wishes.\u201d It is always possible, therefore, for a Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed to provide for his or her non-Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed partner, children or relatives by leaving a will.\n\n\nAdditional details of the laws of inheritance are summarized in the Synopsis and Codification, section IV.C.3.a.\u2013o.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90ddb31c-bb17-4a4d-b544-fe02db1e8c83": {"__data__": {"id_": "90ddb31c-bb17-4a4d-b544-fe02db1e8c83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "844abeca-a0e8-42a4-8b2d-6caf622a8ac8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "6bd77545825f4671b13ada538536357190c05de02870b9193d626817f4761659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "24a82fef-6893-47d1-8029-f5e539aa63f9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "1aaab7e4ffc2fcfbd085bd0a6ee50c5d6e740f902facc54c801003376fc97f65", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7b3fe1e9-565f-4958-aaaf-b1f45860ac12", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "795861b1ede36607ea5bcfc4251e3b12f6b4b789d50a0f8884d7ae0e3cbcecff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "31f4b32e0899dcb56df760e7a88b87302016e245c04d01129a268203be4cb01e", "text": "Additional details of the laws of inheritance are summarized in the Synopsis and Codification, section IV.C.3.a.\u2013o.\n\n\n39. to the brothers, five parts \u2026 to the sisters, four parts \u00b620\nQuestions and Answers amplifies the provisions of the law as it relates to the shares of the inheritance allocated to the brothers and sisters of the deceased. If the brother or sister is from the same father as the deceased, he or she will inherit his or her full allotted share. If, however, the brother or sister is from another father he or she will inherit only two-thirds of the allotted share, the remaining one-third reverting to the House of Justice (Q&A 6). Further, in the case where the deceased has full brothers or full sisters among his heirs, half-brothers and half-sisters from the mother\u2019s side do not inherit (Q&A 53). The half-brothers and half-sisters will, of course, be due to receive inheritance from their own father\u2019s estate.\n\n\n40. the teachers \u00b620\nIn a Tablet, \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 compares teachers who are involved with the spiritual education of the child to the \u201cspiritual father\u201d who \u201cendoweth his child with life everlasting.\u201d He explains that this is the reason that \u201cteachers are listed among the heirs\u201d in the \u201claw of God.\u201d\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h specifies the conditions under which the teacher inherits and the share he or she receives (Q&A 33).\n\n\n41. When We heard the clamor of the children as yet unborn, We doubled their share and decreased those of the rest. \u00b620\nIn the B\u00e1b\u2019s laws of inheritance the children of the deceased were allotted nine parts consisting of 540 shares. This allocation constituted less than a quarter of the whole estate. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h doubled their portion to 1,080 shares and reduced those allotted to the other six categories of heirs. He also outlines the precise intention of this verse and its implications for the distribution of the inheritance (Q&A 5).\n\n\n42. the House of Justice \u00b621\nIn referring to the House of Justice in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h does not always explicitly distinguish between the Universal House of Justice and the Local House of Justice, both of which institutions are ordained in that Book. He usually refers simply to \u201cthe House of Justice,\u201d leaving open for later clarification the level or levels of the whole institution to which each law would apply.\nIn a Tablet enumerating the revenues of the local treasury, \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 includes those inheritances for which there are no heirs, thus indicating that the House of Justice referred to in these passages of the Aqdas relating to inheritance is the local one.\n\n\n43. Should the deceased leave offspring, but none of the other categories of heirs \u00b622\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h clarifies that \u201cThis ruling hath both general and specific application, which is to say that whenever any category of this latter class of heirs is absent, two-thirds of their inheritance pass to the offspring and the remaining third to the House of Justice\u201d (Q&A 7).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b3fe1e9-565f-4958-aaaf-b1f45860ac12": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b3fe1e9-565f-4958-aaaf-b1f45860ac12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "844abeca-a0e8-42a4-8b2d-6caf622a8ac8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "6bd77545825f4671b13ada538536357190c05de02870b9193d626817f4761659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "90ddb31c-bb17-4a4d-b544-fe02db1e8c83", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "31f4b32e0899dcb56df760e7a88b87302016e245c04d01129a268203be4cb01e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6df8aa9c-a4bc-41b2-9d24-31c68b658d78", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "cb8a34b01667daa2b799dd5d9de9d1551abf544b6b4e0d2620fe4dd6741ee353", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "795861b1ede36607ea5bcfc4251e3b12f6b4b789d50a0f8884d7ae0e3cbcecff", "text": "43. Should the deceased leave offspring, but none of the other categories of heirs \u00b622\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h clarifies that \u201cThis ruling hath both general and specific application, which is to say that whenever any category of this latter class of heirs is absent, two-thirds of their inheritance pass to the offspring and the remaining third to the House of Justice\u201d (Q&A 7).\n\n\n44. We have assigned the residence and personal clothing of the deceased to the male, not female, offspring, nor to the other heirs. \u00b625\nIn a Tablet, \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 indicates that the residence and personal clothing of a deceased man remain in the male line. They pass to the eldest son and in the absence of the eldest son, they pass to the second-eldest son, and so on. He explains that this provision is an expression of the law of primogeniture, which has invariably been upheld by the Law of God. In a Tablet to a follower of the Faith in Persia He wrote: \u201cIn all the Divine Dispensations the eldest son hath been given extraordinary distinctions. Even the station of prophethood hath been his birthright.\u201d With the distinctions given to the eldest son, however, go concomitant duties. For example, he has the moral responsibility, for the sake of God, to care for his mother and also to consider the needs of the other heirs.\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h clarifies various aspects of this part of the law of inheritance. He specifies that if there be more than one residence, the principal and most important one passes to the male offspring. The remaining residences will, together with the other possessions of the deceased, have to be divided among the heirs (Q&A 34), and He indicates that in the absence of male offspring, two-thirds of the principal residence and the personal clothing of the deceased father will revert to the female issue and one-third to the House of Justice (Q&A 72). Further, when the deceased is a woman, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h states that all her used clothing is to be equally divided amongst her daughters. Her unworn clothing, jewels and property must be divided among her heirs, as well as her used clothing if she leaves no daughter (Q&A 37).\n\n\n45. Should the son of the deceased have passed away in the days of his father and have left children, they will inherit their father\u2019s share \u00b626\nThis aspect of the law applies only in the case of the son who predeceases his father or mother. If the daughter of the deceased be dead and leave issue, her share will have to be divided according to the seven categories specified in the Most Holy Book (Q&A 54).\n\n\n46. If the deceased should leave children who are under age, their share of the inheritance must be entrusted to a reliable individual \u00b627\nThe word \u201cam\u00edn,\u201d translated in this paragraph as \u201creliable individual\u201d and \u201ctrustee,\u201d conveys in Arabic a wide range of meanings connected principally with the idea of trustworthiness, but signifying also such qualities as reliability, loyalty, faithfulness, uprightness, honesty, and so forth.

This is that hidden knowledge which shall never change, since its beginning is with nine \u00b629\nIn the Arabic Bay\u00e1n the B\u00e1b described His inheritance law as being \u201cin accordance with a hidden knowledge in the Book of God\u2014a knowledge that shall never change or be replaced.\u201d He also stated that the numbers by which the division of the inheritance was expressed had been invested with a significance intended to aid in the recognition of Him Whom God will make manifest.\nThe \u201cnine\u201d mentioned here is represented in the Arabic text by the letter \u201c\u1e6c\u00e1,\u201d which is its equivalent in the abjad notation (see Glossary). It is the first element of the B\u00e1b\u2019s division of inheritance, where He designates \u201cnine parts\u201d as the share of the children. The significance of nine lies in its being the numerical equivalent of the Greatest Name \u201cBah\u00e1,\u201d alluded to in the next part of this verse as \u201cthe concealed and manifest, the inviolable and unapproachably exalted Name.\u201d (See also note 33.)\n\n\n49. The Lord hath ordained that in every city a House of Justice be established \u00b630\nThe institution of the House of Justice consists of elected councils which operate at the local, national and international levels of society. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h ordains both the Universal House of Justice and the Local Houses of Justice in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas. \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1, in His Will and Testament, provides for the Secondary (National or Regional) Houses of Justice and outlines the method to be pursued for the election of the Universal House of Justice.\nIn the verse cited above, the reference is to the Local House of Justice, an institution which is to be elected in a locality whenever there are nine or more resident adult Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds. For this purpose, the definition of adult was temporarily fixed at the age of 21 years by the Guardian, who indicated it was open to change by the Universal House of Justice in the future.\nLocal and Secondary Houses of Justice are, for the present, known as Local Spiritual Assemblies and National Spiritual Assemblies. Shoghi Effendi has indicated that this is a \u201ctemporary appellation\u201d which, \n\n\n\u2026as the position and aims of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith are better understood and more fully recognized, will gradually be superseded by the permanent and more appropriate designation of House of Justice. Not only will the present-day Spiritual Assemblies be styled differently in future, but they will be enabled also to add to their present functions those powers, duties, and prerogatives necessitated by the recognition of the Faith of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, not merely as one of the recognized religious systems of the world, but as the State Religion of an independent and Sovereign Power.\n\n\n50. the number of Bah\u00e1 \u00b630\nThe abjad numerical equivalent of \u201cBah\u00e1\u201d is nine.

The Universal House of Justice has clarified that this guidance concerning consultation was revealed before Spiritual Assemblies had been established and was in answer to a question about the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed teachings on consultation. The House of Justice affirms that the emergence of Spiritual Assemblies, to which the friends may always turn for assistance, in no way prohibits them from following the procedure outlined in Questions and Answers. This approach may be used by the friends, should they wish, when they desire to consult on their personal problems.\n\n\n53. Build ye houses of worship throughout the lands \u00b631\nThe Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed House of Worship is dedicated to the praise of God. The House of Worship forms the central edifice of the Mashriqu\u2019l-Adhk\u00e1r (the Dawning-place of the Praise of God), a complex which, as it unfolds in the future, will comprise in addition to the House of Worship a number of dependencies dedicated to social, humanitarian, educational, and scientific pursuits. \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 describes the Mashriqu\u2019l-Adhk\u00e1r as \u201cone of the most vital institutions in the world,\u201d and Shoghi Effendi indicates that it exemplifies in tangible form the integration of \u201cBah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed worship and service.\u201d Anticipating the future development of this institution, Shoghi Effendi envisages that the House of Worship and its dependencies \u201cshall afford relief to the suffering, sustenance to the poor, shelter to the wayfarer, solace to the bereaved, and education to the ignorant.\u201d In the future, Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Houses of Worship will be constructed in every town and village.\n\n\n54. The Lord hath ordained that those of you who are able shall make pilgrimage to the sacred House \u00b632\nTwo sacred Houses are covered by this ordinance, the House of the B\u00e1b in Sh\u00edr\u00e1z and the House of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h in Baghd\u00e1d. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h has specified that pilgrimage to either of these two Houses fulfills the requirement of this passage (Q&A 25, 29). In two separate Tablets, known as S\u00fariy-i-\u1e24ajj (Q&A 10), Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h has prescribed specific rites for each of these pilgrimages. In this sense, the performance of a pilgrimage is more than simply visiting these two Houses.\nAfter the passing of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 designated the Shrine of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h at Bahj\u00ed as a place of pilgrimage. In a Tablet, He indicates that the \u201cMost Holy Shrine, the Blessed House in Baghd\u00e1d and the venerated House of the B\u00e1b in Sh\u00edr\u00e1z\u201d are \u201cconsecrated to pilgrimage,\u201d and that it is \u201cobligatory\u201d to visit these places \u201cif one can afford it and is able to do so, and if no obstacle stands in one\u2019s way.\u201d No rites have been prescribed for pilgrimage to the Most Holy Shrine.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c753adf-d021-4d95-997d-026f4feb910d": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c753adf-d021-4d95-997d-026f4feb910d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "844abeca-a0e8-42a4-8b2d-6caf622a8ac8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "6bd77545825f4671b13ada538536357190c05de02870b9193d626817f4761659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e418bf5e-f427-45b7-adf7-9884a46e252d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "47306d8a05e2d3e13d12ab0d998b3cf7142ccaf1ff57ccf17e2501d6f25099d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5c1c3dd4-82ed-4f48-a51d-dcad13777014", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "d7ec6721d192fc26cf24ced0da0092dbd7a0267b76388413aaaf07468c38d85d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d663ab5c93eabf5eb82535a5746ca6e7dd8738377d679b47e09ce2da99fa5522", "text": "55. and from this He hath exempted women as a mercy on His part \u00b632\nIn the Bay\u00e1n, the B\u00e1b enjoined the ordinance of pilgrimage once in a lifetime upon those of His followers who were financially able to undertake the journey. He stated that the obligation was not binding on women in order to spare them the rigors of travel. \nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h likewise exempts women from His pilgrimage requirements. The Universal House of Justice has clarified that this exemption is not a prohibition, and that women are free to perform the pilgrimage.\n\n\n56. to engage in some occupation \u00b633\nIt is obligatory for men and women to engage in a trade or profession. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h exalts \u201cengagement in such work\u201d to the \u201crank of worship\u201d of God. The spiritual and practical significance of this law, and the mutual responsibility of the individual and society for its implementation are explained in a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi:\n\n\nWith reference to Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s command concerning the engagement of the believers in some sort of profession: the Teachings are most emphatic on this matter, particularly the statement in the Aqdas to this effect which makes it quite clear that idle people who lack the desire to work can have no place in the new World Order. As a corollary of this principle, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h further states that mendicity should not only be discouraged but entirely wiped out from the face of society. It is the duty of those who are in charge of the organization of society to give every individual the opportunity of acquiring the necessary talent in some kind of profession, and also the means of utilizing such a talent, both for its own sake and for the sake of earning the means of his livelihood. Every individual, no matter how handicapped and limited he may be, is under the obligation of engaging in some work or profession, for work, especially when performed in the spirit of service, is according to Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h a form of worship. It has not only a utilitarian purpose, but has a value in itself, because it draws us nearer to God, and enables us to better grasp His purpose for us in this world. It is obvious, therefore, that the inheritance of wealth cannot make anyone immune from daily work.\n\n\nIn one of His Tablets, \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 states that \u201cif a person is incapable of earning a living, is stricken by dire poverty or becometh helpless, then it is incumbent on the wealthy or the Deputies to provide him with a monthly allowance for his subsistence.\u2026 By \u2018Deputies\u2019 is meant the representatives of the people, that is to say the members of the House of Justice.\u201d (See also note 162 on mendicancy.)\nIn response to a question concerning whether Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s injunction requires a wife and mother, as well as her husband, to work for a livelihood, the Universal House of Justice has explained that Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s directive is for the friends to be engaged in an occupation which will profit themselves and others, and that homemaking is a highly honorable and responsible work of fundamental importance to society.\nConcerning the retirement from work for individuals who have reached a certain age, Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on his behalf stated that \u201cthis is a matter on which the International House of Justice will have to legislate as there are no provisions in the Aqdas concerning it.\u201d\n\n\n57. The kissing of hands hath been forbidden in the Book. \u00b634\nIn a number of earlier religious Dispensations and in certain cultures the kissing of the hand of a religious figure or of a prominent person was expected as a mark of reverence and deference to such persons and as a token of submission to their authority. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h prohibits the kissing of hands and, in His Tablets, He also condemns such practices as prostrating oneself before another person and other forms of behavior that abase one individual in relation to another. (See note 58.)\n\n\n58. To none is it permitted to seek absolution from another soul \u00b634\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h prohibits confession to, and seeking absolution of one\u2019s sins from, a human being.

His secretary has written on his behalf that we\n\n\n\u2026are forbidden to confess to any person, as do the Catholics to their priests, our sins and shortcomings, or to do so in public, as some religious sects do. However, if we spontaneously desire to acknowledge we have been wrong in something, or that we have some fault of character, and ask another person\u2019s forgiveness or pardon, we are quite free to do so.\n\n\nThe Universal House of Justice has also clarified that Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s prohibition concerning the confession of sins does not prevent an individual from admitting transgressions in the course of consultations held under the aegis of Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed institutions. Likewise, it does not preclude the possibility of seeking advice from a close friend or of a professional counselor regarding such matters.\n\n\n59. Amongst the people is he who seateth himself amid the sandals by the door whilst coveting in his heart the seat of honor. \u00b636\nTraditionally in the East it has been the practice to remove sandals and shoes before entering a gathering. The part of a room farthest from the entrance is regarded as the head of the room and a place of honor where the most prominent among those present are seated. Others sit in descending order towards the door, by which the shoes and sandals have been left and where the most lowly would sit.\n\n\n60. And among the people is he who layeth claim to inner knowledge \u00b636\nThis is a reference to people who claim access to esoteric knowledge and whose attachment to such knowledge veils them from the Revelation of the Manifestation of God. Elsewhere Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h affirms: \u201cThey that are the worshipers of the idol which their imaginations have carved, and who call it Inner Reality, such men are in truth accounted among the heathen.\u201d\n\n\n61. How many a man hath secluded himself in the climes of India, denied himself the things that God hath decreed as lawful, imposed upon himself austerities and mortifications \u00b636\nThese verses constitute the prohibition of monasticism and asceticism. See the Synopsis and Codification, section IV.D. 1.y.iii.-iv. In the Words of Paradise Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h amplifies these provisions. He states: \u201cLiving in seclusion or practicing asceticism is not acceptable in the presence of God,\u201d and He calls upon those involved to \u201cobserve that which will cause joy and radiance.\u201d He instructs those who have taken up \u201ctheir abodes in the caves of the mountains\u201d or who have \u201crepaired to graveyards at night\u201d to abandon these practices, and He enjoins them not to deprive themselves of the \u201cbounties\u201d of this world which have been created by God for humankind. And in the Tablet of Bish\u00e1r\u00e1t, while acknowledging the \u201cpious deeds\u201d of monks and priests, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h calls upon them to \u201cgive up the life of seclusion and direct their steps towards the open world and busy themselves with that which will profit themselves and others.\u201d He also grants them leave \u201cto enter into wedlock that they may bring forth one who will make mention of God.\u201d\n\n\n62.

It has particular implications not only for the disposition of endowments but also for the succession of authority following the passing of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h (see note 145) and of \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, in the Book of His Covenant, appointed \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1, His eldest son, as the Center of His Covenant and the Head of the Faith. \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1, in His Will and Testament, appointed Shoghi Effendi, His eldest grandson, as the Guardian and Head of the Faith.\nThis passage of the Aqdas, therefore, anticipates the succession of chosen Agh\u1e63\u00e1n and thus the institution of the Guardianship and envisages the possibility of a break in their line. The passing of Shoghi Effendi in 1957 precipitated the very situation provided for in this passage, in that the line of Agh\u1e63\u00e1n ended before the Universal House of Justice had been established (see note 67).\n\n\n67. revert to the people of Bah\u00e1 \u00b642\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h provides for the possibility that the line of Agh\u1e63\u00e1n would terminate prior to the establishment of the Universal House of Justice. He designated that in such a situation \u201cendowments shall revert to the people of Bah\u00e1.\u201d The term \u201cpeople of Bah\u00e1\u201d is used with a number of different meanings in the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Writings. In this instance, they are described as those \u201cwho speak not except by His leave and judge not save in accordance with what God hath decreed in this Tablet.\u201d Following the passing of Shoghi Effendi in 1957, the Hands of the Cause of God directed the affairs of the Cause until the election of the Universal House of Justice in 1963 (see note 183).\n\n\n68. Shave not your heads \u00b644\nIn some religious traditions it is considered desirable to shave one\u2019s head. The shaving of the head is forbidden by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, and He makes it clear that the provision contained in His S\u00fariy-i-\u1e24ajj requiring pilgrims to the Holy House in Sh\u00edr\u00e1z to shave their heads has been superseded through this verse of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas (Q&A 10).\n\n\n69. it is not seemly to let the hair pass beyond the limit of the ears \u00b644\nShoghi Effendi has made clear that, unlike the prohibition on shaving the head, this law forbidding the growing of the hair beyond the lobe of the ear pertains only to men.

Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h here confirms the B\u00e1b\u2019s ruling.\n\n\n73. Take heed lest, when partaking of food, ye plunge your hands into the contents of bowls and platters. \u00b646\nThis prohibition was defined by Shoghi Effendi as \u201cplunging one\u2019s hand in food.\u201d In many parts of the world it has been customary to eat with the hands from a communal bowl.\n\n\n74. Adopt ye such usages as are most in keeping with refinement. \u00b646\nThis is the first of several passages referring to the importance of refinement and cleanliness. The original Arabic word \u201cla\u1e6d\u00e1fah\u201d rendered here as \u201crefinement,\u201d has a wide range of meanings with both spiritual and physical implications, such as elegance, gracefulness, cleanliness, civility, politeness, gentleness, delicacy and graciousness, as well as being subtle, refined, sanctified and pure. In accordance with the context of the various passages where it occurs in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas, it has been translated either as \u201crefinement\u201d or \u201ccleanliness.\u201d\n\n\n75. He Who is the Dawning-place of God\u2019s Cause hath no partner in the Most Great Infallibility. \u00b647\nIn the Tablet of Ishr\u00e1q\u00e1t, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h affirms that the Most Great Infallibility is confined to the Manifestations of God.\nChapter 45 in Some Answered Questions is devoted to an explanation by \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 of this verse of the Aqdas. In this chapter He stresses, among other things, the inseparability of essential \u201cinfallibility\u201d from the Manifestations of God, and asserts that \u201cwhatever emanates from Them is identical with the truth, and conformable to reality,\u201d that \u201cThey are not under the shadow of the former laws,\u201d and \u201cWhatever They say is the word of God, and whatever They perform is an upright action.\u201d\n\n\n76.

God hath imposed a fine on every adulterer and adulteress, to be paid to the House of Justice \u00b649\nAlthough the term translated here as adultery refers, in its broadest sense, to unlawful sexual intercourse between either married or unmarried individuals (see note 36 for a definition of the term), \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 has specified that the punishment here prescribed is for sexual intercourse between persons who are unmarried. He indicates that it remains for the Universal House of Justice to determine the penalty for adultery committed by a married individual. (See also Q&A 49.)\nIn one of His Tablets, \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 refers to some of the spiritual and social implications of the violation of the laws of morality and, concerning the penalty here described, He indicates that the aim of this law is to make clear to all that such an action is shameful in the eyes of God and that, in the event that the offense can be established and the fine imposed, the principal purpose is the exposure of the offenders\u2014that they are shamed and disgraced in the eyes of society. He affirms that such exposure is in itself the greatest punishment.\nThe House of Justice referred to in this verse is presumably the Local House of Justice, currently known as the Local Spiritual Assembly.\n\n\n78. nine mithq\u00e1ls of gold, to be doubled if they should repeat the offense \u00b649\nA mithq\u00e1l is a unit of weight. The weight of the traditional mithq\u00e1l used in the Middle East is equivalent to 24 nakhuds. However, the mithq\u00e1l used by the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds consists of 19 nakhuds, \u201cin accordance with the specification of the Bay\u00e1n\u201d (Q&A 23). The weight of nine of these mithq\u00e1l equals 32.775 grams or 1.05374 troy ounces.\nIn relation to the application of the fine, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h clearly specifies that each succeeding fine is double the preceding one (Q&A 23); thus the fine imposed increases in geometrical progression. The imposition of this fine is intended for a future condition of society, at which time the law will be supplemented and applied by the Universal House of Justice.\n\n\n79. We have made it lawful for you to listen to music and singing. \u00b651\n\u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 has written that \u201cAmong certain nations of the East, music was considered reprehensible.\u201d Though the Qur\u2019\u00e1n contains no specific guidance on the subject, some Muslims consider listening to music as unlawful, while others tolerate music within certain bounds and subject to particular conditions.\nThere are a number of passages in the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Writings in praise of music. \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1, for example, asserts that \u201cmusic, sung or played, is spiritual food for soul and heart.\u201d\n\n\n80. O ye Men of Justice! \u00b652\nIt has been elucidated in the writings of \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 and Shoghi Effendi that, while the membership of the Universal House of Justice is confined to men, both women and men are eligible for election to Secondary and Local Houses of Justice (currently designated as National and Local Spiritual Assemblies).\n\n\n81.

Verily, it is enjoined upon you to offer a feast, once in every month \u00b657\nThis injunction has become the basis for the holding of monthly Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed festivities and as such constitutes the ordination of the Nineteen Day Feast. In the Arabic Bay\u00e1n the B\u00e1b called upon His followers to gather together once every nineteen days to show hospitality and fellowship. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h here confirms this and notes the unifying role of such occasions.\n\u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 and Shoghi Effendi after Him have gradually unfolded the institutional significance of this injunction. \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 emphasized the importance of the spiritual and devotional character of these gatherings. Shoghi Effendi, besides further elaborating the devotional and social aspects of the Feast, has developed the administrative element of such gatherings and, in systematically instituting the Feast, has provided for a period of consultation on the affairs of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed community, including the sharing of news and messages.\nIn answer to a question as to whether this injunction is obligatory, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h stated it was not (Q&A 48). Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on his behalf further comments:\n\n\nAttendance at Nineteen Day Feasts is not obligatory but very important, and every believer should consider it a duty and privilege to be present on such occasions.\n\n\n83. If ye should hunt with beasts or birds of prey, invoke ye the Name of God when ye send them to pursue their quarry; for then whatever they catch shall be lawful unto you, even should ye find it to have died. \u00b660\nBy this law, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h greatly simplifies practices and religious regulations of the past relating to hunting. He has also stated that hunting with such weapons as bows and arrows, guns, and the like, is included in this ruling, but that the consumption of game if it is found dead in a trap or a net is prohibited (Q&A 24).\n\n\n84. hunt not to excess \u00b660\nWhile hunting is not forbidden by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, He warns against excessive hunting. The Universal House of Justice will, in due course, have to consider what constitutes an excess in hunting.\n\n\n85. He hath granted them no right to the property of others. \u00b661\nThe injunction to show kindness to Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s kindred does not give them a share in the property of others. This is in contrast to Sh\u00ed\u2018ih Muslim practice, in which lineal descendants of Mu\u1e25ammad are entitled to receive a share of a certain tax.\n\n\n86. Should anyone intentionally destroy a house by fire, him also shall ye burn; should anyone deliberately take another\u2019s life, him also shall ye put to death. \u00b662\nThe law of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h prescribes the death penalty for murder and arson, with the alternative of life imprisonment (see note 87).\nIn His Tablets \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 explains the difference between revenge and punishment. He affirms that individuals do not have the right to take revenge, that revenge is despised in the eyes of God, and that the motive for punishment is not vengeance, but the imposition of a penalty for the committed offense. In Some Answered Questions, He confirms that it is the right of society to impose punishments on criminals for the purpose of protecting its members and defending its existence. \nWith regard to this provision, Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on his behalf gives the following explanation:", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2c715faa-47aa-4e96-b688-10eb8fcb88ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "2c715faa-47aa-4e96-b688-10eb8fcb88ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "844abeca-a0e8-42a4-8b2d-6caf622a8ac8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "6bd77545825f4671b13ada538536357190c05de02870b9193d626817f4761659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb495d23-7b22-4bd0-91cb-19325de0966a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "5897e310e770105eefa0ad61a9215053114325d1d524cd482e8aa4b878ec22d7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "52d53031-4c29-418f-99a2-1a37f028ca77", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "6093d237b797b83331f8a2c4610d9025c605339a9cefd2284d97603d7ca1c033", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "25af628c95e2736141a0025db3df745e3de6e5fcc804387cb70f9a5f6933c1c3", "text": "86. Should anyone intentionally destroy a house by fire, him also shall ye burn; should anyone deliberately take another\u2019s life, him also shall ye put to death. \u00b662\nThe law of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h prescribes the death penalty for murder and arson, with the alternative of life imprisonment (see note 87).\nIn His Tablets \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 explains the difference between revenge and punishment.

In Some Answered Questions, He confirms that it is the right of society to impose punishments on criminals for the purpose of protecting its members and defending its existence. \nWith regard to this provision, Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on his behalf gives the following explanation:\n\n\nIn the Aqdas Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h has given death as the penalty for murder. However, He has permitted life imprisonment as an alternative. Both practices would be in accordance with His Laws. Some of us may not be able to grasp the wisdom of this when it disagrees with our own limited vision; but we must accept it, knowing His Wisdom, His Mercy and His Justice are perfect and for the salvation of the entire world. If a man were falsely condemned to die, can we not believe Almighty God would compensate him a thousandfold, in the next world, for this human injustice? You cannot give up a salutary law just because on rare occasions the innocent may be punished.\n\n\nThe details of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed law of punishment for murder and arson, a law designed for a future state of society, were not specified by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h. The various details of the law, such as degrees of offense, whether extenuating circumstances are to be taken into account, and which of the two prescribed punishments is to be the norm are left to the Universal House of Justice to decide in light of prevailing conditions when the law is to be in operation. The manner in which the punishment is to be carried out is also left to the Universal House of Justice to decide.\nIn relation to arson, this depends on what \u201chouse\u201d is burned. There is obviously a tremendous difference in the degree of offense between the person who burns down an empty warehouse and one who sets fire to a school full of children.\n\n\n87. Should ye condemn the arsonist and the murderer to life imprisonment, it would be permissible according to the provisions of the Book. \u00b662\nShoghi Effendi, in response to a question about this verse of the Aqdas, affirmed that while capital punishment is permitted, an alternative, \u201clife imprisonment,\u201d has been provided \u201cwhereby the rigors of such a condemnation can be seriously mitigated.\u201d He states that \u201cBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h has given us a choice and has, therefore, left us free to use our own discretion within certain limitations imposed by His law.\u201d In the absence of specific guidance concerning the application of this aspect of Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed law, it remains for the Universal House of Justice to legislate on the matter in the future.\n\n\n88. God hath prescribed matrimony unto you. \u00b663\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, in one of His Tablets, states that God, in establishing this law, has made marriage \u201ca fortress for well-being and salvation.\u201d\nThe Synopsis and Codification, section IV.C.1.a.\u2013o., summarizes and synthesizes the provisions in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas and Questions and Answers concerning marriage and the conditions under which it is permitted (Q&A 3, 13, 46, 50, 84, and 92), the law of betrothal (Q&A 43), the payment of the dowry (Q&A 12, 26, 39, 47, 87, and 88), the procedures to be adopted in the event of the prolonged absence of a spouse (Q&A 4 and 27), and sundry other circumstances (Q&A 12 and 47).

Beware that ye take not unto yourselves more wives than two. Whoso contenteth himself with a single partner from among the maidservants of God, both he and she shall live in tranquillity. \u00b663\nWhile the text of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas appears to permit bigamy, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h counsels that tranquillity and contentment derive from monogamy. In another Tablet, He underlines the importance of the individual\u2019s acting in such a way as to \u201cbring comfort to himself and to his partner.\u201d \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1, the authorized Interpreter of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Writings, states that in the text of the Aqdas monogamy is in effect enjoined. He elaborates this theme in a number of Tablets, including the following:\n\n\nKnow thou that polygamy is not permitted under the law of God, for contentment with one wife hath been clearly stipulated. Taking a second wife is made dependent upon equity and justice being upheld between the two wives, under all conditions. However, observance of justice and equity towards two wives is utterly impossible. The fact that bigamy has been made dependent upon an impossible condition is clear proof of its absolute prohibition. Therefore it is not permissible for a man to have more than one wife.\n\n\nPolygamy is a very ancient practice among the majority of humanity. The introduction of monogamy has been only gradually accomplished by the Manifestations of God. Jesus, for example, did not prohibit polygamy, but abolished divorce except in the case of fornication; Mu\u1e25ammad limited the number of wives to four, but making plurality of wives contingent on justice, and reintroducing permission for divorce; Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, Who was revealing His Teachings in the milieu of a Muslim society, introduced the question of monogamy gradually in accordance with the principles of wisdom and the progressive unfoldment of His purpose. The fact that He left His followers with an infallible Interpreter of His Writings enabled Him to outwardly permit two wives in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas but uphold a condition that enabled \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 to elucidate later that the intention of the law was to enforce monogamy.\n\n\n90. he who would take into his service a maid may do so with propriety \u00b663\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h states that a man may employ a maiden for domestic service. This was not permissible under Sh\u00ed\u2018ih Muslim practice unless the employer entered into a marriage contract with her. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h emphasizes that the \u201cservice\u201d referred to in this verse is solely \u201csuch as is performed by any other class of servants, be they young or old, in exchange for wages\u201d (Q&A 30). An employer has no sexual rights over his maid. She is \u201cfree to choose a husband at whatever time she pleaseth,\u201d for the purchase of women is forbidden (Q&A 30).\n\n\n91. This is My bidding unto you; hold fast to it as an assistance to yourselves. \u00b663\nWhile marriage is enjoined in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h clarifies that it is not obligatory (Q&A 46). Shoghi Effendi, in a letter written on his behalf, also declared that \u201cmarriage is by no means an obligation,\u201d and he affirmed that \u201cin the last resort it is for the individual to decide whether he wishes to lead a family life or live in a state of celibacy.\u201d If a person has to wait a considerable period of time before finding a spouse, or ultimately must remain single, it does not mean that the individual is thereby unable to fulfill his or her life\u2019s purpose, which is fundamentally spiritual.\n\n\n92. We have conditioned it \u2026 upon the permission of their parents \u00b665\nIn a letter written on his behalf, Shoghi Effendi has commented on this provision of the law:\n\n\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h has clearly stated the consent of all living parents is required for a Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed marriage. This applies whether the parents are Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds or non-Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds, divorced for years or not.

No marriage may be contracted without payment of a dowry \u00b666\nThe Synopsis and Codification, section IV.C.1.j.i.\u2013v., summarizes the main provisions concerning the dowry. These provisions have their antecedents in the Bay\u00e1n.\nThe dowry is to be paid by the bridegroom to the bride. It is fixed at 19 mithq\u00e1ls of pure gold for city dwellers, and 19 mithq\u00e1ls of silver for village dwellers (see note 94). Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h indicates that, if, at the time of the wedding, the bridegroom is unable to pay the dowry in full, it is permissible for him to issue a promissory note to the bride (Q&A 39).\nWith the Revelation of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h many familiar concepts, customs and institutions are redefined and take on new meaning. One of these is the dowry. The institution of dowry is a very ancient practice in many cultures and takes many forms. In some countries it is a payment made by the parents of the bride to the bridegroom; in others it is a payment made by the bridegroom to the parents of the bride, called a \u201cbride-price.\u201d In both such cases the amount is often quite considerable. The law of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h abolishes all such variants and converts the dowry into a symbolic act whereby the bridegroom presents a gift of a certain limited value to the bride.\n\n\n94. for city dwellers at nineteen mithq\u00e1ls of pure gold, and for village dwellers at the same amount in silver \u00b666\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h specifies that the criterion for determining the dowry payment is the location of the permanent residence of the bridegroom, not of the bride (Q&A 87, 88).\n\n\n95. Whoso wisheth to increase this sum, it is forbidden him to exceed the limit of ninety-five mithq\u00e1ls \u2026 If he content himself, however, with a payment of the lowest level, it shall be better for him according to the Book. \u00b666\nIn answer to a question about the dowry, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h stated:\n\n\nWhatever is revealed in the Bay\u00e1n, in respect to those residing in cities and villages, is approved and should be carried out. However, in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas mention is made of the lowest level. The intention is nineteen mithq\u00e1ls of silver, specified in the Bay\u00e1n for village dwellers. This is more pleasing unto God, provided the two parties agree. The purpose is to promote the comfort of all, and to bring about concord and union among the people. Therefore, the greater the consideration shown in these matters the better it will be \u2026 The people of Bah\u00e1 must associate and deal with each other with the utmost love and sincerity. They should be mindful of the interests of all, especially the friends of God.\n\n\n\u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1, in one of His Tablets, summarized some of the provisions for determining the level of the dowry. The unit of payment mentioned in the extract, cited below, is the \u201cv\u00e1\u1e25id.\u201d One v\u00e1\u1e25id is equivalent to nineteen mithq\u00e1ls. He stated:\n\n\nCity dwellers must pay in gold and village dwellers in silver. It dependeth on the financial means at the disposal of the groom. If he is poor, he payeth one v\u00e1\u1e25id; if of modest means, he payeth two v\u00e1\u1e25ids; if well-to-do, three v\u00e1\u1e25ids; if wealthy, four v\u00e1\u1e25ids; and if very rich, he giveth five v\u00e1\u1e25ids.

If, however, the husband was unaware of the law, the wife must wait until news of her husband reaches her (Q&A 4).\n\n\n97. it behooveth her to wait for a period of nine months, after which there is no impediment to her taking another husband \u00b667\nIn the event of the husband\u2019s failure, either to return at the end of the specified period of time or to notify his wife of a delay, the wife must wait nine months, after which she is free to remarry, though it is preferable for her to wait longer (see note 147 for the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed calendar).\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h states that, in such circumstances, should news reach the wife of \u201cher husband\u2019s death or murder,\u201d she must also wait nine months, prior to remarrying (Q&A 27). \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1, in a Tablet, has further clarified that the nine months\u2019 waiting period following news of the husband\u2019s death applies only if the husband had been away at the time of his death, and not if he dies while at home.\n\n\n98. she should choose the course that is praiseworthy \u00b667\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h defines \u201cthe course that is praiseworthy\u201d as \u201cthe exercise of patience\u201d (Q&A 4).\n\n\n99. two just witnesses \u00b667\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h sets out \u201cthe criterion of justness\u201d in relation to witnesses as \u201ca good reputation among the people.\u201d He states that it is not necessary that the witnesses should be Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds since \u201cThe testimony of all God\u2019s servants, of whatever faith or creed, is acceptable before His Throne\u201d (Q&A 79).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee805dd1-2d4c-433b-b4c3-255fab4d9335": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee805dd1-2d4c-433b-b4c3-255fab4d9335", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "844abeca-a0e8-42a4-8b2d-6caf622a8ac8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "6bd77545825f4671b13ada538536357190c05de02870b9193d626817f4761659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "15d81168-8770-4164-8c23-630a35f24f89", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "337c90a36e6baa9f310b325d5e61a06e2f1c071ade141df3b969daa3a88ccd09", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dfb228a1-49dd-428b-8e74-a38ccc2f8780", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "daca1a67f51ca929a1c708f1888f726fc4174a1c05b6d7e06d407353dd3d5365", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "25665bdcc919f662e414595269c5da0963c8c9ef252addecea4e50fd5ee3235e", "text": "98. she should choose the course that is praiseworthy \u00b667\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h defines \u201cthe course that is praiseworthy\u201d as \u201cthe exercise of patience\u201d (Q&A 4).\n\n\n99. two just witnesses \u00b667\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h sets out \u201cthe criterion of justness\u201d in relation to witnesses as \u201ca good reputation among the people.\u201d He states that it is not necessary that the witnesses should be Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds since \u201cThe testimony of all God\u2019s servants, of whatever faith or creed, is acceptable before His Throne\u201d (Q&A 79).\n\n\n100. Should resentment or antipathy arise between husband and wife, he is not to divorce her but to bide in patience throughout the course of one whole year \u00b668\nDivorce is strongly condemned in the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Teachings. If, however, antipathy or resentment develop between the marriage partners, divorce is permissible after the lapse of one full year. During this year of patience, the husband is obliged to provide for the financial support of his wife and children, and the couple is urged to strive to reconcile their differences. Shoghi Effendi affirms that both the husband and wife \u201chave equal right to ask for divorce\u201d whenever either partner \u201cfeels it absolutely essential to do so.\u201d\nIn Questions and Answers, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h elaborates a number of issues concerning the year of patience, its observance (Q&A 12), establishing the date of its beginning (Q&A 19 and 40), the conditions for reconciliation (Q&A 38), and the role of witnesses and the Local House of Justice (Q&A 73 and 98). In relation to the witnesses, the Universal House of Justice has clarified that in these days the duties of the witnesses in cases of divorce are performed by the Spiritual Assemblies.\nThe detailed provisions of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed laws on divorce are summarized in the Synopsis and Codification, section IV.C.2.a.\u2013i.\n\n\n101. The Lord hath prohibited \u2026 the practice to which ye formerly had recourse when thrice ye had divorced a woman. \u00b668\nThis relates to a law of Isl\u00e1m set out in the Qur\u2019\u00e1n which decreed that under certain conditions a man could not remarry his divorced wife unless she had married and been divorced by another man. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h affirms that this is the practice which has been prohibited in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas (Q&A 31).\n\n\n102. He who hath divorced his wife may choose, upon the passing of each month, to remarry her when there is mutual affection and consent, so long as she hath not taken another husband \u2026 unless, clearly, her circumstances change. \u00b668\nShoghi Effendi states, in a letter written on his behalf, that the intention of \u201cthe passing of each month\u201d is not to impose a limitation, and that it is possible for a divorced couple to remarry at any time after their divorce, so long as neither party is currently married to another person.\n\n\n103. semen is not unclean \u00b674\nIn a number of religious traditions and in Sh\u00ed\u2018ih Muslim practice semen has been declared ritually unclean. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h has here dispelled this concept. See also note 106 below.\n\n\n104. Cleave ye unto the cord of refinement \u00b674\n\u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 refers to the effect of \u201cpurity and holiness, cleanliness and refinement\u201d on the exaltation of \u201cthe human condition\u201d and \u201cthe development of man\u2019s inner reality.\u201d He states: \u201cThe fact of having a pure and spotless body exercises an influence upon the spirit of man.\u201d (See also note 74.)\n\n\n105. Wash ye every soiled thing with water that hath undergone no alteration in any one of the three respects \u00b674\nThe \u201cthree respects\u201d referred to in this verse are changes in the color, taste or smell of the water. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h provides additional guidance concerning pure water and the point at which it is considered unsuitable for use (Q&A 91).\n\n\n106. God hath \u2026 abolished the concept of \u201cuncleanness,\u201d whereby divers things and peoples have been held to be impure. \u00b675\nThe concept of ritual \u201cuncleanness,\u201d as understood and practiced in some tribal societies and in the religious communities of certain earlier Dispensations, has been abolished by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h.

This event, which took place thirty-one days after Naw-R\u00faz, in April 1863, signalized the commencement of the period during which Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h declared His Mission to His companions. In a Tablet, He refers to His Declaration as \u201cthe Day of supreme felicity\u201d and He describes the Garden of Ri\u1e0dv\u00e1n as \u201cthe Spot from which He shed upon the whole of creation the splendors of His Name, the All-Merciful.\u201d Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h spent twelve days in this Garden prior to departing for Istanbul, the place to which He had been banished.\nThe Declaration of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h is celebrated annually by the twelve-day Ri\u1e0dv\u00e1n Festival, described by Shoghi Effendi as \u201cthe holiest and most significant of all Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed festivals\u201d (see notes 138 and 140).\n\n\n108. the Bay\u00e1n \u00b677\nThe Bay\u00e1n, the Mother Book of the B\u00e1b\u00ed Dispensation, is the title given by the B\u00e1b to His Book of Laws, and it is also applied to the entire body of His Writings. The Persian Bay\u00e1n is the major doctrinal work and principal repository of the laws ordained by the B\u00e1b. The Arabic Bay\u00e1n is parallel in content but smaller and less weighty. When describing the Persian Bay\u00e1n in God Passes By Shoghi Effendi indicated that it should be regarded \u201cprimarily as a eulogy of the Promised One rather than a code of laws and ordinances designed to be a permanent guide to future generations\u201d.\n\u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 has written: \u201cThe Bay\u00e1n hath been superseded by the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas, except in respect of such laws as have been confirmed and mentioned in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas.\u201d\n\n\n109. the destruction of books \u00b677\nIn the Tablet of Ishr\u00e1q\u00e1t Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, referring to the fact that the B\u00e1b had made the laws of the Bay\u00e1n subject to His sanction, states that He put some of the B\u00e1b\u2019s laws into effect \u201cby embodying them in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas in different words,\u201d while others He set aside.\nWith regard to the destruction of books, the Bay\u00e1n commanded the B\u00e1b\u2019s followers to destroy all books except those that were written in vindication of the Cause and Religion of God.

As these statements clearly reveal, the B\u00e1b\u00ed Dispensation was essentially in the nature of a religious and indeed social revolution, and its duration had therefore to be short, but full of tragic events, of sweeping and drastic reforms. Those drastic measures enforced by the B\u00e1b and His followers were taken with the view of undermining the very foundations of Sh\u00ed\u2018ih orthodoxy, and thus paving the way for the coming of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h. To assert the independence of the new Dispensation, and to prepare also the ground for the approaching Revelation of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, the B\u00e1b had therefore to reveal very severe laws, even though most of them were never enforced. But the mere fact that He revealed them was in itself a proof of the independent character of His Dispensation and was sufficient to create such widespread agitation, and excite such opposition on the part of the clergy that led them to cause His eventual martyrdom.\n\n\n110. We have permitted you to read such sciences as are profitable unto you, not such as end in idle disputation \u00b677\nThe Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Writings enjoin the acquisition of knowledge and the study of the arts and sciences. Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds are admonished to respect people of learning and accomplishment, and are warned against the pursuit of studies that are productive only of futile wrangling.\nIn His Tablets Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h counsels the believers to study such sciences and arts as are \u201cuseful\u201d and would further \u201cthe progress and advancement\u201d of society, and He cautions against sciences which \u201cbegin with words and end with words,\u201d the pursuit of which leads to \u201cidle disputation.\u201d Shoghi Effendi, in a letter written on his behalf, likened sciences that begin with words and end with words to \u201cfruitless excursions into metaphysical hair-splittings,\u201d and, in another letter, he explained that what Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h primarily intended by such \u201csciences\u201d are \u201cthose theological treatises and commentaries that encumber the human mind rather than help it to attain the truth.\u201d\n\n\n111.

O King of Berlin! \u00b686\nKaiser William I (Wilhelm Friedrich Ludwig, 1797\u20131888), the seventh king of Prussia, was acclaimed first Emperor of Germany in January 1871 at Versailles in France, following the victory of Germany over France in the Franco-Prussian War.\n\n\n118. the one whose power transcended thy power, and whose station excelled thy station \u00b686\nThis is a reference to Napoleon III (1808\u20131873), the Emperor of the French, who was regarded by many historians as the most outstanding monarch of his day in the West.\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h addressed two Tablets to Napoleon III, in the second of which He clearly prophesied that Napoleon\u2019s kingdom would be \u201cthrown into confusion,\u201d that his \u201cempire shall pass\u201d from his hands, and that his people would experience great \u201ccommotions.\u201d\nWithin a year, Napoleon III suffered a resounding defeat, at the hands of Kaiser William I, at the Battle of Sedan in 1870.

Located on the Bosporus, a strait about 31 kilometers long which links the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara, it is the largest city and seaport of Turkey.\nConstantinople was the capital of the Ottoman Empire from 1453 until 1922.

Should anyone acquire one hundred mithq\u00e1ls of gold, nineteen mithq\u00e1ls thereof are God\u2019s and to be rendered unto Him \u00b697\nThis verse establishes \u1e24uq\u00faqu\u2019ll\u00e1h, the Right of God, the offering of a fixed portion of the value of the believer\u2019s possessions. This offering was made to Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h as the Manifestation of God and then, following His Ascension, to \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 as the Center of the Covenant. In His Will and Testament, \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 provided that the \u1e24uq\u00faqu\u2019ll\u00e1h was to be offered \u201cthrough the Guardian of the Cause of God.\u201d There now being no Guardian, it is offered through the Universal House of Justice as the Head of the Faith. This fund is used for the promotion of the Faith of God and its interests as well as for various philanthropic purposes. The offering of the \u1e24uq\u00faqu\u2019ll\u00e1h is a spiritual obligation, the fulfillment of which has been left to the conscience of each Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed. While the community is reminded of the requirements of the law of \u1e24uq\u00faq, no believer may be approached individually to pay it.\nA number of items in Questions and Answers further elaborate this law. The payment of \u1e24uq\u00faqu\u2019ll\u00e1h is based on the calculation of the value of the individual\u2019s possessions. If a person has possessions equal in value to at least nineteen mithq\u00e1ls of gold (Q&A 8), it is a spiritual obligation to pay nineteen percent of the total amount, once only, as \u1e24uq\u00faqu\u2019ll\u00e1h (Q&A 89). Thereafter, whenever one\u2019s income, after all expenses have been paid, increases the value of one\u2019s possessions by the amount of at least nineteen mithq\u00e1ls of gold, one is to pay nineteen percent of this increase, and so on for each further increase (Q&A 8, 90).\nCertain categories of possessions, such as one\u2019s residence, are exempt from the payment of \u1e24uq\u00faqu\u2019ll\u00e1h (Q&A 8, 42, 95), and specific provisions are outlined to cover cases of financial loss (Q&A 44, 45), the failure of investments to yield a profit (Q&A 102) and for the payment of \u1e24uq\u00faq in the event of the person\u2019s death (Q&A 9, 69, 80). (In this latter case, see note 47.)\nExtensive extracts from Tablets, Questions and Answers, and other Writings concerning the spiritual significance of \u1e24uq\u00faqu\u2019ll\u00e1h and the details of its application have been published in a compilation entitled \u1e24uq\u00faqu\u2019ll\u00e1h.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "feed1070-6a80-49a3-88a3-33f9e41f627c": {"__data__": {"id_": "feed1070-6a80-49a3-88a3-33f9e41f627c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "844abeca-a0e8-42a4-8b2d-6caf622a8ac8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "6bd77545825f4671b13ada538536357190c05de02870b9193d626817f4761659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "41fe0ca7-bab4-48ae-9d92-8c2468f99edb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "cfd1baf905cc63fb82aec70ebdadeedc947de8e16d5ac8a4e1cf74f4a583781d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b2bb9738-3ed3-472e-93ff-3b685384c7f2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "1c6f7e605dbe0f80542a685de9de30bd6e6fd3429df06226c889b83a4b71f6aa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "148ac38ef0587d65d1408a983b241636459c53096113b11a69bb2ed9c8bacb32", "text": "126. Various petitions have come before Our throne from the believers, concerning laws from God \u2026 We have, in consequence, revealed this Holy Tablet and arrayed it with the mantle of His Law that haply the people may keep the commandments of their Lord. \u00b698\n\u201cFor a number of years,\u201d Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h states in one of His Tablets, \u201cpetitions reached the Most Holy Presence from various lands begging for the laws of God, but We held back the Pen ere the appointed time had come.\u201d Not until twenty years from the birth of His Prophetic Mission in the S\u00edy\u00e1h-Ch\u00e1l of \u1e6cihr\u00e1n had elapsed did Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h reveal the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas, the Repository of the laws of His Dispensation. Even after its revelation the Aqdas was withheld by Him for some time before it was sent to the friends in Persia.

Hence it is often used in the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Writings to designate the Manifestation of God Himself. (See also note 164.)\n\n\n129. the Mother Book \u00b6103\nThe term \u201cMother Book\u201d is generally used to designate the central Book of a religious Dispensation. In the Qur\u2019\u00e1n and Islamic \u1e24ad\u00edth, the term is used to describe the Qur\u2019\u00e1n itself. In the B\u00e1b\u00ed Dispensation, the Bay\u00e1n is the Mother Book, and the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas is the Mother Book of the Dispensation of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h. Further, the Guardian in a letter written on his behalf has stated that this concept can also be used as a \u201ccollective term indicating the body of the Teachings revealed by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h.\u201d This term is also used in a broader sense to signify the Divine Repository of Revelation.\n\n\n130. Whoso interpreteth what hath been sent down from the heaven of Revelation, and altereth its evident meaning \u00b6105\nIn several of His Tablets, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h affirms the distinction between allegorical verses, which are susceptible to interpretation, and those verses that relate to such subjects as the laws and ordinances, worship and religious observances, whose meanings are evident and which demand compliance on the part of the believers.\nAs explained in notes 145 and 184, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h designated \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1, His eldest Son, as His Successor and the Interpreter of His Teachings. \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 in His turn appointed His eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi, to succeed Him as interpreter of the holy Writ and Guardian of the Cause. The interpretations of \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 and Shoghi Effendi are considered divinely guided and are binding on the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds.\nThe existence of authoritative interpretations does not preclude the individual from engaging in the study of the Teachings and thereby arriving at a personal interpretation or understanding. A clear distinction is, however, drawn in the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Writings between authoritative interpretation and the understanding that each individual arrives at from a study of its Teachings. Individual interpretations based on a person\u2019s understanding of the Teachings constitute the fruit of man\u2019s rational power and may well contribute to a greater comprehension of the Faith. Such views, nevertheless, lack authority. In presenting their personal ideas, individuals are cautioned not to discard the authority of the revealed words, not to deny or contend with the authoritative interpretation, and not to engage in controversy; rather they should offer their thoughts as a contribution to knowledge, making it clear that their views are merely their own.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2bb9738-3ed3-472e-93ff-3b685384c7f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2bb9738-3ed3-472e-93ff-3b685384c7f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "844abeca-a0e8-42a4-8b2d-6caf622a8ac8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "6bd77545825f4671b13ada538536357190c05de02870b9193d626817f4761659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "feed1070-6a80-49a3-88a3-33f9e41f627c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "148ac38ef0587d65d1408a983b241636459c53096113b11a69bb2ed9c8bacb32", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a27d8316-26f6-4e07-b26f-7a33556cf6f0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "df4b07656ec65669dd37aae3a7769b9d5847819cd93712cf8f04f534e9a97141", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1c6f7e605dbe0f80542a685de9de30bd6e6fd3429df06226c889b83a4b71f6aa", "text": "131. approach not the public pools of Persian baths \u00b6106\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h prohibits the use of the pools found in the traditional public bathhouses of Persia. In these baths it was the custom for many people to wash themselves in the same pool and for the water to be changed at infrequent intervals. Consequently, the water was discolored, befouled and unhygienic, and had a highly offensive stench.\n\n\n132. Avoid ye likewise the malodorous pools in the courtyards of Persian homes \u00b6106\nMost houses in Persia used to have a pool in their courtyard which served as a reservoir for water used for cleaning, washing and other domestic purposes. Since the water in the pool was stagnant and was not usually changed for weeks at a time, it tended to develop a very unpleasant odor.\n\n\n133. It is forbidden you to wed your fathers\u2019 wives. \u00b6107\nMarriage with one\u2019s stepmother is here explicitly prohibited. This prohibition also applies to marrying one\u2019s stepfather. Where Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h has expressed a law between a man and a woman it applies mutatis mutandis as between a woman and a man unless the context should make this impossible.\n\u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 and Shoghi Effendi confirmed that, while stepmothers are the only category of relatives mentioned in the text, this does not mean that all other unions within a family are permissible. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h states that it devolves upon the House of Justice to legislate \u201cconcerning the legitimacy or otherwise of marrying one\u2019s relatives\u201d (Q&A 50). \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 has written that the more distant the blood relationship between the couple the better, since such marriages provide the basis for the physical well-being of humanity and are conducive to fellowship among mankind.\n\n\n134. the subject of boys \u00b6107\nThe word translated here as \u201cboys\u201d has, in this context, in the Arabic original, the implication of pederasty. Shoghi Effendi has interpreted this reference as a prohibition on all homosexual relations.\nThe Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed teachings on sexual morality center on marriage and the family as the bedrock of the whole structure of human society and are designed to protect and strengthen that divine institution. Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed law thus restricts permissible sexual intercourse to that between a man and the woman to whom he is married.\nIn a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi it is stated:\n\n\nNo matter how devoted and fine the love may be between people of the same sex, to let it find expression in sexual acts is wrong. To say that it is ideal is no excuse. Immorality of every sort is really forbidden by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, and homosexual relationships He looks upon as such, besides being against nature. To be afflicted this way is a great burden to a conscientious soul. But through the advice and help of doctors, through a strong and determined effort, and through prayer, a soul can overcome this handicap.\n\n\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h makes provision for the Universal House of Justice to determine, according to the degree of the offense, penalties for adultery and sodomy (Q&A 49).\n\n\n135. To none is it permitted to mutter sacred verses before the public gaze as he walketh in the street or marketplace \u00b6108\nThis is an allusion to the practice of certain clerics and religious leaders of earlier Dispensations who, out of hypocrisy and affectation, and in order to win the praise of their followers, would ostentatiously mutter prayers in public places as a demonstration of their piety. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h forbids such behavior and stresses the importance of humility and genuine devotion to God.\n\n\n136. Unto everyone hath been enjoined the writing of a will. \u00b6109\nAccording to the Teachings of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, the individual has a duty to write a will and testament, and is free to dispose of his estate in whatever manner he chooses (see note 38).\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h affirms that in drawing up his will \u201ca person hath full jurisdiction over his property,\u201d since God has permitted the individual \u201cto deal with that which He hath bestowed upon him in whatever manner he may desire\u201d (Q&A 69).

All Feasts have attained their consummation in the two Most Great Festivals, and in the two other Festivals that fall on the twin days \u00b6110\nThis passage establishes four great festivals of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed year. The two designated by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h as \u201cthe two Most Great Festivals\u201d are, first, the Festival of Ri\u1e0dv\u00e1n, which commemorates Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s Declaration of His Prophetic Mission in the Garden of Ri\u1e0dv\u00e1n in Baghd\u00e1d during twelve days in April/May 1863 and is referred to by Him as \u201cthe King of Festivals\u201d and, second, the B\u00e1b\u2019s Declaration, which occurred in May 1844 in Sh\u00edr\u00e1z. The first, ninth and twelfth days of the Festival of Ri\u1e0dv\u00e1n are Holy Days (Q&A 1), as is the day of the Declaration of the B\u00e1b.\nThe \u201ctwo other Festivals\u201d are the anniversaries of the births of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h and the B\u00e1b. In the Muslim lunar calendar these fall on consecutive days, the birth of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h on the second day of the month of Mu\u1e25arram 1233 A.H. (12 November 1817), and the birth of the B\u00e1b on the first day of the same month 1235 A.H. (20 October 1819), respectively. They are thus referred to as the \u201cTwin Birthdays\u201d and Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h states that these two days are accounted as one in the sight of God (Q&A 2). He states that, should they fall within the month of fasting, the command to fast shall not apply on those days (Q&A 36). Given that the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed calendar (see notes 26 and 147) is a solar calendar, it remains for the Universal House of Justice to determine whether the Twin Holy Birthdays are to be celebrated on a solar or lunar basis.3\n\n\n139. the first day of the month of Bah\u00e1 \u00b6111\nIn the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed calendar the first month of the year and the first day of each month are given the name \u201cBah\u00e1.\u201d The day of Bah\u00e1 of the month of Bah\u00e1 is thus the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed New Year, Naw-R\u00faz, which was ordained by the B\u00e1b as a festival and is here confirmed by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h (see notes 26 and 147).\nIn addition to the seven Holy Days ordained in these passages of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas, the anniversary of the Martyrdom of the B\u00e1b was also commemorated as a Holy Day in the lifetime of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h and, as a corollary to this, \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 added the observance of the Ascension of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, making nine Holy Days in all. Two other anniversaries which are observed, but on which work is not suspended, are the Day of the Covenant and the anniversary of the Passing of \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1. See the section on the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed calendar in The Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed World, volume XVIII.\n\n\n140.

God had formerly laid upon each one of the believers the duty of offering before Our throne priceless gifts from among his possessions. Now \u2026 We have absolved them of this obligation. \u00b6114\nThis passage abrogates a provision of the Bay\u00e1n which decreed that all objects unparalleled of their kind should, upon the appearance of Him Whom God will make manifest, be rendered unto Him. The B\u00e1b explained that, since the Manifestation of God is beyond compare, whatever is peerless in its kind should rightfully be reserved for Him, unless He decrees otherwise.\n\n\n142. the hour of dawn \u00b6115\nWith reference to attending dawn prayers in the Mashriqu\u2019l-Adhk\u00e1r, the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed House of Worship, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h has explained that, although the actual time specified in the Book of God is \u201cthe hour of dawn,\u201d it is acceptable at any time from \u201cthe earliest dawn of day, between dawn and sunrise, or even up to two hours after sunrise\u201d (Q&A 15).\n\n\n143.

Some of His Tablets also bear the mark of one of His seals. The Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed World, volume V, p. 4, contains a photograph of a number of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s seals.\n\n\n144. It is inadmissible that man, who hath been endowed with reason, should consume that which stealeth it away. \u00b6119\nThere are many references in the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Writings which prohibit the use of wine and other intoxicating drinks and which describe the deleterious effect of such intoxicants on the individual. In one of His Tablets, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h states:\n\n\nBeware lest ye exchange the Wine of God for your own wine, for it will stupefy your minds, and turn your faces away from the Countenance of God, the All-Glorious, the Peerless, the Inaccessible. Approach it not, for it hath been forbidden unto you by the behest of God, the Exalted, the Almighty.\n\n\n\u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 explains that the Aqdas prohibits \u201cboth light and strong drinks,\u201d and He states that the reason for prohibiting the use of alcoholic drinks is because \u201calcohol leadeth the mind astray and causeth the weakening of the body.\u201d\nShoghi Effendi, in letters written on his behalf, states that this prohibition includes not only the consumption of wine but of \u201ceverything that deranges the mind,\u201d and he clarifies that the use of alcohol is permitted only when it constitutes part of a medical treatment which is implemented \u201cunder the advice of a competent and conscientious physician, who may have to prescribe it for the cure of some special ailment.\u201d\n\n\n145. turn your faces toward Him Whom God hath purposed, Who hath branched from this Ancient Root \u00b6121\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h here alludes to \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 as His Successor and calls upon the believers to turn towards Him. In the Book of the Covenant, His Will and Testament, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h discloses the intention of this verse. He states: \u201cThe object of this sacred verse is none other except the Most Mighty Branch.\u201d The \u201cMost Mighty Branch\u201d is one of the titles conferred by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h on \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1.

The number of months in a year, appointed in the Book of God, is nineteen. \u00b6127\nThe Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed year, in accordance with the Bad\u00ed\u2018 calendar, consists of nineteen months of nineteen days each, with the addition of certain intercalary days (four in an ordinary year and five in a leap year) between the eighteenth and nineteenth months in order to adjust the calendar to the solar year.4 The B\u00e1b named the months after certain attributes of God. The Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed New Year, Naw-R\u00faz, is astronomically fixed, coinciding with the March equinox (see note 26). For further details, including the names of the days of the week and the months, see the section on the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed calendar in The Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed World, volume XVIII.\n\n\n148. the first hath been adorned with this Name which overshadoweth the whole of creation \u00b6127\nIn the Persian Bay\u00e1n, the B\u00e1b bestowed the name \u201cBah\u00e1\u201d on the first month of the year (see note 139).\n\n\n149. The Lord hath decreed that the dead should be interred in coffins \u00b6128\nIn the Bay\u00e1n, the B\u00e1b prescribed that the deceased should be interred in a coffin made of crystal or polished stone. Shoghi Effendi, in a letter written on his behalf, explained that the significance of this provision was to show respect for the human body which \u201cwas once exalted by the immortal soul of man.\u201d \nIn brief, the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed law for the burial of the dead states that it is forbidden to carry the body for more than one hour\u2019s journey from the place of death; that the body should be wrapped in a shroud of silk or cotton, and on its finger should be placed a ring bearing the inscription \u201cI came forth from God, and return unto Him, detached from all save Him, holding fast to His Name, the Merciful, the Compassionate\u201d; and that the coffin should be of crystal, stone or hard fine wood. A specific Prayer for the Dead (see note 10) is ordained, to be said before interment. As affirmed by \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 and the Guardian, this law precludes cremation of the dead. The formal prayer and the ring are meant to be used for those who have attained the age of maturity, i.e. 15 years of age (Q&A 70).\nWith regard to the material from which the coffin is to be made, the spirit of the law is that coffins should be of as durable a material as possible. Hence, the Universal House of Justice has explained that, in addition to the materials specified in the Aqdas, there is no objection to using the hardest wood available or concrete for the casket. For the present, the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds are left free to make their own choices in this matter.\n\n\n150. the Point of the Bay\u00e1n \u00b6129\nThe \u201cPoint of the Bay\u00e1n\u201d is one of the titles by which the B\u00e1b referred to Himself.\n\n\n151. the deceased should be enfolded in five sheets of silk or cotton \u00b6130\nIn the Bay\u00e1n, the B\u00e1b specified that the body of the deceased should be wrapped in five sheets of silk or cotton. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h confirmed this provision and added the stipulation that for \u201cthose whose means are limited a single sheet of either fabric will suffice.\u201d\nWhen asked whether the \u201cfive sheets\u201d mentioned in the law referred to \u201cfive full-length shrouds\u201d or \u201cfive cloths which were hitherto customarily used,\u201d Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h responded that the intention is the \u201cuse of five cloths\u201d (Q&A 56).\nConcerning the way in which the body should be wrapped, there is nothing in the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Writings to define how the wrapping of the body is to be done, either when \u201cfive cloths\u201d are used or only \u201ca single sheet.\u201d At present, the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds are free to use their judgment in the matter.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62ab26e3-d0f9-446f-a148-6477fb468dea": {"__data__": {"id_": "62ab26e3-d0f9-446f-a148-6477fb468dea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "844abeca-a0e8-42a4-8b2d-6caf622a8ac8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "6bd77545825f4671b13ada538536357190c05de02870b9193d626817f4761659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "01d712e1-e11b-4861-8d48-b22d730fbd82", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "9631eed7840ef6e8b22e2bc4efe667ab6b455078f99712e3a81309d3f77259f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e08c122f-e993-44a7-b35e-6049fa828e5a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "602f0bbfd9e43ab417cea60bb6235133d82945bef0b39b54b6f643d164d3b7de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c3e011da9ecd8248bf76e32cdcbe22ae2f5b3db57bd5e5b532ddc9bb619c9f14", "text": "152.

(See Q&A 29, 32 and note 54.)\nShoghi Effendi explained that \u201cthe other sites wherein the throne of your Lord \u2026 hath been established\u201d refers to those places where the Person of the Manifestation of God has resided. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h states that \u201cthe people of the areas where these are situated may choose to preserve either each house\u201d wherein He resided, \u201cor one of them\u201d (Q&A 32). Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed institutions have identified, documented, and where possible, acquired and restored a number of the historical sites associated with the Twin Manifestations.\n\n\n155. Take heed lest ye be prevented by aught that hath been recorded in the Book from hearkening unto this, the Living Book \u00b6134\nThe \u201cBook\u201d is the record of the revealed Word of the Manifestations of God. The \u201cLiving Book\u201d is a reference to the Person of the Manifestation.\nThese words contain an allusion to a statement of the B\u00e1b in the Persian Bay\u00e1n about the \u201cLiving Book,\u201d which He identifies as Him Whom God will make manifest. In one of His Tablets Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h Himself states: \u201cThe Book of God hath been sent down in the form of this Youth.\u201d\nIn this verse of the Aqdas, and again in paragraph 168 of the Aqdas, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h refers to Himself as the \u201cLiving Book.\u201d He cautions the \u201cfollowers of every other Faith\u201d against seeking \u201creasons in their Holy Books\u201d for refuting the utterances of the \u201cLiving Book.\u201d He admonishes the people not to allow what has been recorded in the \u201cBook\u201d to prevent them from recognizing His Station and from holding fast to what is in this new Revelation.\n\n\n156. tribute to this Revelation, from the Pen of Him Who was My Herald \u00b6135\nThe \u201ctribute\u201d that Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h quotes in this passage is from the Arabic Bay\u00e1n. \n\n\n157. \u201cThe Qiblih is indeed He Whom God will make manifest; whenever He moveth, it moveth, until He shall come to rest.\u201d \u00b6137\nFor a discussion of this verse see notes 7 and 8.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e08c122f-e993-44a7-b35e-6049fa828e5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e08c122f-e993-44a7-b35e-6049fa828e5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "844abeca-a0e8-42a4-8b2d-6caf622a8ac8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "6bd77545825f4671b13ada538536357190c05de02870b9193d626817f4761659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "62ab26e3-d0f9-446f-a148-6477fb468dea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "c3e011da9ecd8248bf76e32cdcbe22ae2f5b3db57bd5e5b532ddc9bb619c9f14", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b8eb5a09-f19c-49a1-ae3d-124c74547be0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "ce892307b0a1ed18fc2f6c772914b3e34c294a4142555c0149fa069f28be9723", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "602f0bbfd9e43ab417cea60bb6235133d82945bef0b39b54b6f643d164d3b7de", "text": "156. tribute to this Revelation, from the Pen of Him Who was My Herald \u00b6135\nThe \u201ctribute\u201d that Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h quotes in this passage is from the Arabic Bay\u00e1n. \n\n\n157. \u201cThe Qiblih is indeed He Whom God will make manifest; whenever He moveth, it moveth, until He shall come to rest.\u201d \u00b6137\nFor a discussion of this verse see notes 7 and 8.\n\n\n158.

Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, in quoting this law, points to the fact that, in revealing it, the B\u00e1b had clearly anticipated the possibility that the Cause of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h would rise to prominence before that of the B\u00e1b Himself.\nIn God Passes By Shoghi Effendi points out that the Bay\u00e1n \u201cshould be regarded primarily as a eulogy of the Promised One rather than a code of laws and ordinances designed to be a permanent guide to future generations.\u201d \u201cDesignedly severe in the rules and regulations it imposed,\u201d he continues, \u201crevolutionizing in the principles it instilled, calculated to awaken from their age-long torpor the clergy and the people, and to administer a sudden and fatal blow to obsolete and corrupt institutions, it proclaimed, through its drastic provisions, the advent of the anticipated Day, the Day when \u2018the Summoner shall summon to a stern business,\u2019 when He will \u2018demolish whatever hath been before Him, even as the Apostle of God demolished the ways of those that preceded Him\u2019\u201d (see also note 109).\n\n\n159.

He explains that \u201csince there can be no tie of direct intercourse to bind the one true God with His creation\u201d God ordains that \u201cin every age and dispensation a pure and stainless Soul be made manifest in the kingdoms of earth and heaven.\u201d This \u201cmysterious and ethereal Being,\u201d the Manifestation of God, has a human nature which pertains to \u201cthe world of matter\u201d and a spiritual nature \u201cborn of the substance of God Himself.\u201d He is also endowed with a \u201cdouble station\u201d:\n\n\nThe first station, which is related to His innermost reality, representeth Him as One Whose voice is the voice of God Himself \u2026 The second station is the human station, exemplified by the following verses: \u201cI am but a man like you.\u201d \u201cSay, praise be to my Lord! Am I more than a man, an apostle?\u201d\n\n\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h also affirms that, in the spiritual realm, there is an \u201cessential unity\u201d between all the Manifestations of God. They all reveal the \u201cBeauty of God,\u201d manifest His names and attributes, and give utterance to His Revelation. In this regard, He states:\n\n\nWere any of the all-embracing Manifestations of God to declare: \u201cI am God!\u201d He, verily, speaketh the truth, and no doubt attacheth thereto. For it hath been repeatedly demonstrated that through their Revelation, their attributes and names, the Revelation of God, His name and His attributes, are made manifest in the world.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8eb5a09-f19c-49a1-ae3d-124c74547be0": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8eb5a09-f19c-49a1-ae3d-124c74547be0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "844abeca-a0e8-42a4-8b2d-6caf622a8ac8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "6bd77545825f4671b13ada538536357190c05de02870b9193d626817f4761659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e08c122f-e993-44a7-b35e-6049fa828e5a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "602f0bbfd9e43ab417cea60bb6235133d82945bef0b39b54b6f643d164d3b7de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a3c04415-1ee5-4d03-b14d-53764175b696", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "498c25814cf9c338d842dee299618a17b50937269d7004455bd0bb679a5f7513", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ce892307b0a1ed18fc2f6c772914b3e34c294a4142555c0149fa069f28be9723", "text": "Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h also affirms that, in the spiritual realm, there is an \u201cessential unity\u201d between all the Manifestations of God.

Divinity, whenever I mention it, indicateth My complete and absolute self-effacement. This is the station in which I have no control over mine own weal or woe nor over my life nor over my resurrection.\n\n\nAnd, regarding His own relationship to God, He testifies:\n\n\nWhen I contemplate, O my God, the relationship that bindeth me to Thee, I am moved to proclaim to all created things \u201cverily I am God!\u201d; and when I consider my own self, lo, I find it coarser than clay!\n\n\n\n\n161. payment of Zak\u00e1t \u00b6146\nZak\u00e1t is referred to in the Qur\u2019\u00e1n as a regular charity binding upon Muslims. In due course the concept evolved into a form of alms tax which imposed the obligation to give a fixed portion of certain categories of income, beyond specified limits, for the relief of the poor, for various charitable purposes, and to aid the Faith of God. The limit of exemption varied for different commodities, as did the percentage payable on the portion assessable.\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h states that the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed law of Zak\u00e1t follows \u201cwhat hath been revealed in the Qur\u2019\u00e1n\u201d (Q&A 107). Since such issues as the limits for exemption, the categories of income concerned, the frequency of payments, and the scale of rates for the various categories of Zak\u00e1t are not mentioned in the Qur\u2019\u00e1n, these matters will have to be set forth in the future by the Universal House of Justice.

It is unlawful to beg, and it is forbidden to give to him who beggeth. \u00b6147\nIn a Tablet \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 expounds the meaning of this verse. He states that \u201cmendicancy is forbidden and that giving charity to people who take up begging as their profession is also prohibited.\u201d He further points out in that same Tablet: \u201cThe object is to uproot mendicancy altogether. However, if a person is incapable of earning a living, is stricken by dire poverty or becometh helpless, then it is incumbent on the wealthy or the Deputies to provide him with a monthly allowance for his subsistence \u2026 By \u2018Deputies\u2019 is meant the representatives of the people, that is to say the members of the House of Justice.\u201d\nThe prohibition against giving charity to people who beg does not preclude individuals and Spiritual Assemblies from extending financial assistance to the poor and needy or from providing them with opportunities to acquire such skills as would enable them to earn a livelihood (see note 56).\n\n\n163.

He explains that the purpose of the law is that one should change those furnishings that become old, lose their luster and provoke repugnance. It does not apply to such things as rare or treasured articles, antiques or jewelry.\n\n\n167. Wash your feet \u00b6152\nThe believers are exhorted in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas to bathe regularly, to wear clean clothes and generally to be the essence of cleanliness and refinement.

Ye have been prohibited from making use of pulpits. Whoso wisheth to recite unto you the verses of his Lord, let him sit on a chair placed upon a dais \u00b6154\nThese provisions have their antecedent in the Persian Bay\u00e1n. The B\u00e1b forbade the use of pulpits for the delivery of sermons and the reading of the Text. He specified, instead, that to enable all to hear the Word of God clearly, a chair for the speaker should be placed upon a platform.\nIn comments on this law, \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 and Shoghi Effendi have made it clear that in the Mashriqu\u2019l-Adhk\u00e1r (where sermons are prohibited and only the words of Holy Scripture may be read) the reader may stand or sit, and if necessary to be better heard, may use a low movable platform, but that no pulpit is permitted. In the case of meetings in places other than the Mashriqu\u2019l-Adhk\u00e1r, it is also permissible for the reader or speaker to sit or stand, and to use a platform. In one of His Tablets, when reiterating the prohibition of the use of pulpits in any location, \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 has stressed that when Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00eds deliver their speeches in gatherings, they are to do so in an attitude of utmost humility and self-abnegation.\n\n\n169. Gambling \u00b6155\nThe activities that are included in this prohibition have not been outlined in the Writings of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h. As both \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 and Shoghi Effendi have indicated, it is left to the Universal House of Justice to specify the details of this prohibition. In response to questions about whether lotteries, betting on such things as horse races and football games, bingo, and the like, are included under the prohibition of gambling, the Universal House of Justice has indicated that this is a matter that will be considered in detail in the future. In the meantime, the Assemblies and individuals are counseled not to make an issue of these matters and to leave it to the conscience of the individual believers.\nThe House of Justice has ruled that it is not appropriate for funds for the Faith to be raised through lotteries, raffles, and games of chance.\n\n\n170. the use of opium \u2026 any substance that induceth sluggishness and torpor \u00b6155\nThis prohibition of the use of opium is reiterated by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h in the final paragraph of the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas.

God protect us from the punishment He inflicteth on the user. According to the explicit Text of the Most Holy Book, it is forbidden, and its use is utterly condemned. Reason showeth that smoking opium is a kind of insanity, and experience attesteth that the user is completely cut off from the human kingdom. May God protect all against the perpetration of an act so hideous as this, an act which layeth in ruins the very foundation of what it is to be human, and which causeth the user to be dispossessed for ever and ever. For opium fasteneth on the soul so that the user\u2019s conscience dieth, his mind is blotted away, his perceptions are eroded. It turneth the living into the dead. It quencheth the natural heat. No greater harm can be conceived than that which opium inflicteth. Fortunate are they who never even speak the name of it; then think how wretched is the user.\nO ye lovers of God! In this, the cycle of Almighty God, violence and force, constraint and oppression, are one and all condemned. It is, however, mandatory that the use of opium be prevented by any means whatsoever, that perchance the human race may be delivered from this most powerful of plagues. And otherwise, woe and misery to whoso falleth short of his duty to his Lord.\n\n\nIn one of His Tablets \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 has stated concerning opium: \u201cthe user, the buyer and the seller are all deprived of the bounty and grace of God.\u201d\nIn yet another Tablet, \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 has written:\n\n\nRegarding hashish you have pointed out that some Persians have become habituated to its use. Gracious God! This is the worst of all intoxicants, and its prohibition is explicitly revealed. Its use causeth the disintegration of thought and the complete torpor of the soul. How could anyone seek the fruit of the infernal tree, and by partaking of it, be led to exemplify the qualities of a monster? How could one use this forbidden drug, and thus deprive himself of the blessings of the All-Merciful?\nAlcohol consumeth the mind and causeth man to commit acts of absurdity, but this opium, this foul fruit of the infernal tree, and this wicked hashish extinguish the mind, freeze the spirit, petrify the soul, waste the body and leave man frustrated and lost.\n\n\nIt should be noted that the above prohibition against taking certain classes of drugs does not forbid their use when prescribed by qualified physicians as part of a medical treatment.\n\n\n171. the \u201cmystery of the Great Reversal in the Sign of the Sovereign\u201d \u00b6157\nShaykh A\u1e25mad-i-A\u1e25s\u00e1\u2019\u00ed (1753\u20131831), who was the founder of the Shaykh\u00ed School and the first of the \u201ctwin luminaries that heralded the advent of the Faith of the B\u00e1b,\u201d prophesied that at the appearance of the Promised One all things would be reversed, the last would be first, the first last. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h in one of His Tablets refers to the \u201csymbol and allusion\u201d of the \u201cmystery of the Great Reversal in the Sign of the Sovereign.\u201d He states: \u201cThrough this reversal He hath caused the exalted to be abased and the abased to be exalted,\u201d and He recalls that \u201cin the days of Jesus, it was those who were distinguished for their learning, the men of letters and religion, who denied Him, whilst humble fisherman made haste to gain admittance into the Kingdom\u201d (see also note 172).

According to the abjad reckoning, the numerical value of each of these letters is 6, 1 and 6 respectively. Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on his behalf to one of the believers in the East provides an interpretation of this verse of the Aqdas. He states that the \u201cUpright Alif\u201d refers to the advent of the B\u00e1b. The first letter with its value of six, which comes before the Alif, is a symbol of earlier Dispensations and Manifestations which predate the B\u00e1b, while the third letter, which also has a numerical value of six, stands for Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s supreme Revelation which was made manifest after the Alif.\n\n\n173. It hath been forbidden you to carry arms unless essential \u00b6159\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h confirms an injunction contained in the Bay\u00e1n which makes it unlawful to carry arms, unless it is necessary to do so. With regard to circumstances under which the bearing of arms might be \u201cessential\u201d for an individual, \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 gives permission to a believer for self-protection in a dangerous environment. Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on his behalf has also indicated that, in an emergency, when there is no legal force at hand to appeal to, a Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed is justified in defending his life. There are a number of other situations in which weapons are needed and can be legitimately used; for instance, in countries where people hunt for their food and clothing, and in such sports as archery, marksmanship, and fencing.\nOn the societal level, the principle of collective security enunciated by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h (see Gleanings from the Writings of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, CXVII) and elaborated by Shoghi Effendi (see the Guardian\u2019s letters in The World Order of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h) does not presuppose the abolition of the use of force, but prescribes \u201ca system in which Force is made the servant of Justice,\u201d and which provides for the existence of an international peacekeeping force that \u201cwill safeguard the organic unity of the whole commonwealth.\u201d In the Tablet of Bish\u00e1r\u00e1t, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h expresses the hope that \u201cweapons of war throughout the world may be converted into instruments of reconstruction and that strife and conflict may be removed from the midst of men.\u201d\nIn that same Tablet Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h stresses the importance of fellowship with the followers of all religions; He also states that \u201cthe law of holy war hath been blotted out from the Book.\u201d\n\n\n174. and permitted you to attire yourselves in silk \u00b6159\nAccording to Islamic practice, the wearing of silk by men was generally forbidden, except in times of holy war. This prohibition, which was not based on the verses of the Qur\u2019\u00e1n, was abrogated by the B\u00e1b. \n\n\n175. The Lord hath relieved you \u2026 of the restrictions that formerly applied to clothing and to the trim of the beard. \u00b6159\nMany rules about dress had their origins in the laws and traditional practices of the world\u2019s religions. For example, the Sh\u00ed\u2018ih clergy adopted for themselves a distinctive headdress and robes and, at one time, forbade the people to adopt European attire. Muslim practice, in its desire to emulate the custom of the Prophet, also introduced a number of restrictions with regard to the trim of the moustache and the length of the beard.\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h removed such limitations on one\u2019s apparel and beard. He leaves such matters to the \u201cdiscretion\u201d of the individual, and at the same time calls upon the believers not to transgress the bounds of propriety and to exercise moderation in all that pertains to dress.\n\n\n176.

Call ye to mind the shaykh whose name was Mu\u1e25ammad-\u1e24asan \u00b6166\nShaykh Mu\u1e25ammad-\u1e24asan, one of the leading exponents of Sh\u00ed\u2018ih Isl\u00e1m, rejected the B\u00e1b. The author of voluminous writings on Sh\u00ed\u2018ih jurisprudence, he is reported to have died around 1850.\nNab\u00edl, in The Dawn-Breakers, describes the encounter that took place in Najaf between Mull\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00edy-i-Bas\u1e6d\u00e1m\u00ed, one of the Letters of the Living, and Shaykh Mu\u1e25ammad-\u1e24asan. During the meeting, Mull\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed announced the manifestation of the B\u00e1b and extolled the potency of His Revelation. At the instigation of the shaykh, Mull\u00e1 \u2018Al\u00ed was forthwith pronounced a heretic and expelled from the assembly.

He joined the company of the defenders of the Fort of Shaykh \u1e6cabars\u00ed and perished during that siege.\n\n\n180. Take heed lest the word \u201cProphet\u201d withhold you from this Most Great Announcement \u00b6167\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h cautions people \u201cof insight\u201d not to allow their interpretations of the Holy Scriptures to prevent them from recognizing the Manifestation of God. Followers of each religion have tended to allow their devotion to its Founder to cause them to perceive His Revelation as the final Word of God and to deny the possibility of the appearance of any subsequent Prophet. This has been the case of Judaism, Christianity and Isl\u00e1m. Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h denies the validity of this concept of finality both in relation to past Dispensations and to His own. With regard to Muslims, He wrote in the Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n that the \u201cpeople of the Qur\u2019\u00e1n \u2026 have allowed the words \u2018Seal of the Prophets\u2019 to veil their eyes,\u201d \u201cto obscure their understanding, and deprive them of the grace of all His manifold bounties!\u201d He affirms that \u201cthis theme hath \u2026 been a sore test unto all mankind,\u201d and laments the fate of \u201cthose who, clinging unto these words, have disbelieved in Him Who is their true Revealer.\u201d The B\u00e1b refers to this same theme when He warns: \u201cLet not names shut you out as by a veil from Him Who is their Lord, even the name of Prophet, for such a name is but a creation of His utterance.\u201d", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b8bdffe-290d-4a63-9e47-fbf3fa6c76cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b8bdffe-290d-4a63-9e47-fbf3fa6c76cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "844abeca-a0e8-42a4-8b2d-6caf622a8ac8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "6bd77545825f4671b13ada538536357190c05de02870b9193d626817f4761659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dbd39dbc-48d7-4eba-a490-fff500642290", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "1293d60ed47e7a872df26fe1b164abaad1a35bd753733d96612b109db0a4a467", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "21115107-82d1-4791-a12f-47f9322833e9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "f5a2b06cab67411edc9a1931f71fb7ccae8b3d3f5815a19dccf530dece5d5870", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "452ba2f8a9b74f9600ca4062362659c3cbac82299f2004e2f361f36a17275be0", "text": "181. any reference to \u201cVicegerency\u201d debar you from the sovereignty of Him Who is the Vicegerent of God \u00b6167\nThe word here translated \u201cVicegerency\u201d is, in the original Arabic, \u201cvil\u00e1yat,\u201d which has a range of meanings including \u201cvicegerency,\u201d \u201cguardianship,\u201d \u201cprotectorship\u201d and \u201csuccessorship.\u201d It is used in relation to God Himself, to His Manifestation, or to those who are the appointed Successors of a Manifestation.\nIn this verse of the Aqdas, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h warns against allowing such concepts to blind one to the \u201csovereignty\u201d of the new Divine Manifestation, the true \u201cVicegerent of God.\u201d\n\n\n182.

He dedicated himself to the promotion of the teachings of Shaykh A\u1e25mad. The opinions he expressed became the subject of controversy among his supporters and opponents alike.\nRegarded as one of the leading savants and prolific authors of his age, he composed numerous books and epistles in the various fields of learning that were cultivated in those times. He actively opposed both the B\u00e1b and Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, and used his treatises to attack the B\u00e1b and His Teachings. In the Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n, Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h condemns the tone and content of his writings and singles out for criticism one of his works which contains negative allusions to the B\u00e1b. Shoghi Effendi describes him as \u201cinordinately ambitious and hypocritical\u201d and describes how he \u201cat the special request of the Sh\u00e1h had in a treatise viciously attacked the new Faith and its doctrines.\u201d\n\n\n183. O ye the learned ones in Bah\u00e1 \u00b6173\nBah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h eulogizes the learned among His followers. In the Book of His Covenant, He wrote: \u201cBlessed are the rulers and learned among the people of Bah\u00e1.\u201d Referring to this statement, Shoghi Effendi has written:\n\n\nIn this holy cycle the \u201clearned\u201d are, on the one hand, the Hands of the Cause of God, and, on the other, the teachers and diffusers of His Teachings who do not rank as Hands, but who have attained an eminent position in the teaching work. As to the \u201crulers\u201d they refer to the members of the Local, National and International Houses of Justice. The duties of each of these souls will be determined in the future.\n\n\nThe Hands of the Cause of God were individuals appointed by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h and charged with various duties, especially those of protecting and propagating His Faith. In Memorials of the Faithful \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 referred to other outstanding believers as Hands of the Cause, and in His Will and Testament He included a provision calling upon the Guardian of the Faith to appoint Hands of the Cause at his discretion. Shoghi Effendi first raised posthumously a number of the believers to the rank of Hands of the Cause, and during the latter years of his life appointed a total of 32 believers from all continents to this position. In the period between the passing of Shoghi Effendi in 1957 and the election of the Universal House of Justice in 1963, the Hands of the Cause directed the affairs of the Faith in their capacity as Chief Stewards of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s embryonic World Commonwealth (see note 67). In November 1964, the Universal House of Justice determined that it could not legislate to make it possible to appoint Hands of the Cause. Instead, by a decision of the House of Justice in 1968, the functions of the Hands of the Cause in relation to protecting and propagating the Faith were extended into the future by the creation of the Continental Boards of Counselors, and in 1973 through the establishment of the International Teaching Center, which has its seat in the Holy Land.\nThe Universal House of Justice appoints the Counselor members of the International Teaching Center and the Continental Counselors. Members of Auxiliary Boards are appointed by the Continental Counselors.

We accepted the verses of God \u2026 which He presented unto Us \u00b6175\nIn His Tablet addressed to \u201cHim Who will be made manifest,\u201d the B\u00e1b characterizes the Bay\u00e1n as an offering from Him to Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h. See Selections from the Writings of the B\u00e1b.\n\n\n187.

This word has been used in the Qur\u2019\u00e1n as God\u2019s bidding calling creation into being.\n\n\n189. this new World Order \u00b6181\nIn the Persian Bay\u00e1n, the B\u00e1b stated: \u201cWell is it with him who fixeth his gaze upon the Order of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, and rendereth thanks unto his Lord. For He will assuredly be made manifest. God hath indeed irrevocably ordained it in the Bay\u00e1n.\u201d Shoghi Effendi identifies this \u201cOrder\u201d with the System Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h envisages in the Aqdas, in which He testifies to its revolutionizing effect on the life of humanity and reveals the laws and principles which govern its operation.\nThe features of the \u201cnew World Order\u201d are delineated in the Writings of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h and \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1 and in the letters of Shoghi Effendi and the Universal House of Justice. The institutions of the present-day Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Administrative Order, which constitute the \u201cstructural basis\u201d of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019s World Order, will mature and evolve into the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed World Commonwealth. In this regard, Shoghi Effendi affirms that the Administrative Order \u201cwill, as its component parts, its organic institutions, begin to function with efficiency and vigor, assert its claim and demonstrate its capacity to be regarded not only as the nucleus but the very pattern of the New World Order destined to embrace in the fullness of time the whole of mankind.\u201d\nFor additional information on the evolution of this new World Order, see, for example, the letters of Shoghi Effendi published in The World Order of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "90c7d5bf-3cc0-406c-8c13-3292bc2da817": {"__data__": {"id_": "90c7d5bf-3cc0-406c-8c13-3292bc2da817", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "844abeca-a0e8-42a4-8b2d-6caf622a8ac8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "6bd77545825f4671b13ada538536357190c05de02870b9193d626817f4761659", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "21115107-82d1-4791-a12f-47f9322833e9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "f5a2b06cab67411edc9a1931f71fb7ccae8b3d3f5815a19dccf530dece5d5870", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0e85e288-2df5-4e71-b680-ad707f00cdbb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/home/psyborg/Documents/kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_name": "kitab-i-aqdas_eng.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 393363, "creation_date": "2024-03-04", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-04", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-04"}, "hash": "ca94c6b880614ed44311c43b82e4fa36e6e5c3b6978f857fbe397ca8bf8205da", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "61a25a37ec1b610480d0aba52414b65906a260460f5476d4aeff9e210637bbcd", "text": "190.

M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ya\u1e25y\u00e1 was nominated by the B\u00e1b to serve as a figurehead for the B\u00e1b\u00ed community pending the imminent manifestation of the Promised One.

His pretensions were eventually rejected by all but a few, who became known as Azal\u00eds (see note 177). He is described by Shoghi Effendi as the \u201cArch-Breaker of the Covenant of the B\u00e1b\u201d (see God Passes By, chapter X).\n\n\n191. remember how We nurtured thee by day and by night for service to the Cause \u00b6184\nIn God Passes By, Shoghi Effendi refers to the fact that Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, Who was thirteen years older than M\u00edrz\u00e1 Ya\u1e25y\u00e1, had counseled him and watched over his early youth and manhood.\n\n\n192.

Though He Himself had stringently forbidden His followers, on several occasions, both verbally and in writing, any retaliatory acts against their tormentors, and had even sent back to Beirut an irresponsible Arab convert, who had meditated avenging the wrongs suffered by his beloved Leader, seven of the companions clandestinely sought out and slew three of their persecutors, among whom were Siyyid Mu\u1e25ammad and \u00c1q\u00e1 J\u00e1n.\nThe consternation that seized an already oppressed community was indescribable.

The second stage, in the distant future, would be the eventual adoption of one single language and common script for all on earth.\n\n\n194. We have appointed two signs for the coming of age of the human race \u00b6189\nThe first sign of the coming of age of humanity referred to in the Writings of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h is the emergence of a science which is described as that \u201cdivine philosophy\u201d which will include the discovery of a radical approach to the transmutation of elements. This is an indication of the splendors of the future stupendous expansion of knowledge.\nConcerning the \u201csecond\u201d sign which Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h indicates to have been revealed in the Kit\u00e1b-i-Aqdas, Shoghi Effendi states that Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, \u201c\u2026in His Most Holy Book, has enjoined the selection of a single language and the adoption of a common script for all on earth to use, an injunction which, when carried out, would, as He Himself affirms in that Book, be one of the signs of the \u2018coming of age of the human race.\u2019\u201d \nFurther insight into this process of mankind\u2019s coming of age and proceeding to maturity is provided by the following statement of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h:\n\n\nOne of the signs of the maturity of the world is that no one will accept to bear the weight of kingship. Kingship will remain with none willing to bear alone its weight. That day will be the day whereon wisdom will be manifested among mankind.\n\n\nThe coming of age of the human race has been associated by Shoghi Effendi with the unification of the whole of mankind, the establishment of a world commonwealth, and an unprecedented stimulus to \u201cthe intellectual, the moral, and spiritual life of the entire human race.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nKey to Passages Translated by Shoghi Effendi\n\n\n\n\nAbbreviations of Sources\nBA        Shoghi Effendi.
